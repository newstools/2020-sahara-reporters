Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has lifted the 24-hour curfew earlier imposed on the state in the wake of the protests to end police brutality and bad governance. The governor, however, said starting from today, Saturday (October 24, 2020), residents could begin their normal activities in the state. Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu Akeredolu disclosed this in a statement by the Commissioner of Information in the state, Mr Donald Ojogo. The governor said the decision to lift the curfew followed the consultations he had with the heads of all security agencies after a preliminary assessment of the security situation in the state. According to him, the decision was further encouraged by the relative peace in Akure, the state capital, as normalcy has gradually returned to the city. "The relative peace in the state capital, Akure appears very encouraging just as the people's resolve, especially the youths, not to allow brigandage under any guise is equally palpable. It is, therefore, only normal that law-abiding residents are allowed to go about their legitimate businesses," the statement said.
