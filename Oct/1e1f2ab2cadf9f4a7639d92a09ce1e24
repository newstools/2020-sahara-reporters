Protesters in Lagos calling for an end to police brutality in the county perpetrated by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad will spend a third night demonstrating, SaharaReporters can confirm. The protests, which started on Wednesday, have been peaceful, disrupted largely by officers of the Nigeria Police Force.  The demonstrators will conduct sit-out overnight in front of the Lagos State House of Assembly in Alausa after vowing not to leave until SARS was disbanded. One of the protest organisers, Juwon Sanya-Olu, who spoke with SaharaReporters on Friday evening said, “We will be here all night. No going back, we will eat here, we have asked a DJ to come and play us music and we will be here until our demands are met.”  PHOTONEWS: @PoliceNG Task Force Arrives Alausa With Detention Trucks As Protesters Plan To Spend Third Night Demonstrating Against Police Brutality@followlasg @jidesanwoolu #EndSARS #EndSarsProtests #EndPoliceBrutality #EndSarsNow pic.twitter.com/RVxfsBwH1S
