The Nigeria Youth Congress has condemned the attack on #EndSARS protesters in Abuja and Lagos by suspected hoodlums. The NYC in a statement by its President, Blessing Akinlosotu, expressed belief in the holistic reform of the Nigeria Police Force and has set up a fact-finding team to proffer a permanent solution that will end police brutality on the youth in the country.  The group stressed that violence was not an option at this critical point as assertion of counter force to pro-SARS individuals will not bring the tenets of democratic values in order. The NYC believes that proper conduct of youths at this critical time was far more essential in accomplishing set goals. "NYC will be having a working document soonest that will solve the problems in the police for the betterment of Nigeria and as such task youths to remain calm in the current storms, “We hereby call on President Muhammadu Buhari and Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to urgently commence investigation into the incidents occasioned by attacks of innocent protesters in Abuja and Lagos to further foster the confidence of Nigerians on his administration,” the group said.
