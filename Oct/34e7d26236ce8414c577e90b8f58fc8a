Yaba Magistrate Court, Lagos, has released on bail 30 protesters arrested in Lagos on Thursday. The protesters were part of those that took to the streets under the aegis of the #RevolutionNow to express their anger against bad governance, economic hardship and recent increase in petrol price and electricity tariff.  To effect their release, the protesters were asked to provide a surety and sum of N50,000 as part of their bail bonds, according to Stanley Imhanruor (Esq), legal representative of the arrested protesters, who spokeÂ  with SaharaReporters. He said, "The magistrate granted the 30 of them bail and asked them to pay the sum of N50,000, N10,000 to be paid to the registrar of the court, and also a civil servant who has a tax clearance." Some of the protesters arrested were picked by the police at bus stations while some were dragged down from buses transporting them home.
