After being unable to meet his bail term, the judge varied the condition for Maina to produce one senator, who must sign a bail bond in the sum of N500m and accompany him to court on every trial day. Ndume subsequently agreed to stand surety for Maina but rather than present original documents, submitted forged ones to the court to perfect Maina’s bail.
