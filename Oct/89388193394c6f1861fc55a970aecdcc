A traffic warden attempted to run away from his work when protesters approached the intersection where he was directing traffic in the Central Business District of Abuja. Then what happened next was unexpected. The #EndSARS protesters gathered around him and gave him water, soda, snacks, fruits and food.  The protesters told him that they appreciated his work, that he was not an enemy, that they were agitating for police reform, that a better policing system would serve all Nigerians, and that efficient police is all that they want. Overwhelmed by the kind gesture, the tall, lanky traffic warden thanked the protesters profusely.
