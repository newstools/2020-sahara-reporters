Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, has said President Muhammadu Buhari will soon join Omar al-Bashir, Laurent Gbagbo and Charles Taylor in prison or on exile over the shooting of #EndSARS protesters in Lagos. Armed men in military uniform had on Tuesday opened fire on peaceful protesters demanding an end to police brutality and state repression at the Lekki Toll Gate area of Lagos.  Al-Bashir, Gbagbo and Taylor are former Presidents of Sudan, Ivory Coast and Liberia respectively, who were forced out of power after committing heinous crimes against their people. “For the ‪#LekkiMassacre of peaceful unarmed ‪#EndSARS protesters, General ‪@MBuhari will join Omar al-Bashir, Charles Taylor and Laurent Gbagbo either in prison or on exile. “The name Buhari will be like mud in Nigeria and his children will consider changing their surname out of shame,” Omokri posted on Twitter. President Buhari is yet to speak days after the killing of innocent Nigerians by the army and police across the country.
