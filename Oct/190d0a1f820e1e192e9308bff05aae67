It was gathered that Umar, Aseeya and Abdulaziz Ganduje have already started jostling to take over from the lawmaker with their fatherâ€™s support.  The governor, it was learnt, ordered Jobe to stop the construction of Rimingado-Gulu Road in his constituency. A source said Ganduje called the lawmaker on phone on Tuesday night and directed him to demobilise the contractors from site or he would order their arrest. The lawmaker, however, denied being attacked by his constituents, adding that the news of the incident was orchestrated by his detractors.
