The #ENDSARS protest has drawn international attention after the United Kingdom urged the Nigerian Government to ensure accountability within the police. "Significant protests over #SARS demonstrating Nigerian peopleâ€™s desire for police reform. Peaceful protests are powerful. Police Act recently passed by @MBuhari provides good foundation to build more accountable community police force," British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, said.
