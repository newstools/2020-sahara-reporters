Taiwo Adeleke, who works at the Emergency and Accident Unit of the government-owned hospital, wrote on Sunday that he was already "depressed".  Adeleke had taken to WhatsApp to drop a suicide note for friends. It reads, "If anything happens to me, you all know who to hold responsible. I'm depressed. This might be the end. I'm not safe anymore." The nurse had allegedly taken to the social media to call out the authority of UNIMEDTH for refusing to pay health workers their salaries.
