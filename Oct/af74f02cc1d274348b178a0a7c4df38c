Some residents of Lagos have commenced a three-day protest to call for the scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police Force. The protest is part of the push for the reform of the police system to put an end to the extra-judicial activities of the agency.

Twitter/#LagosProtests Recall that musician, Azeez Fashola popularly known as Naira Marley, proposed a similar #ENDSARS protest but chickened out and cancelled it at the last minute. Naira Marley then backtracked to condemn the agitation for the scrapping of SARS, describing those calling for its end as robbers. See Also
