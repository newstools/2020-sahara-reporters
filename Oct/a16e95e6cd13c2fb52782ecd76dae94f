"Two sons of the area were separately attacked, leaving one dead and the other badly injured just one day after peace meeting to mediate between Fulani and Bachama/Batta communities. "One of the victims, Kennedy Bitrus, sustained injuries following his attack on Friday by herdsmen while returning from Mayo Lope under Lau Local Government Area of Taraba State. "He was attacked by the Marauders with sophisticated weapons and is currently receiving medical attention at a health facility in Numan, Adamawa State. "A day after, on Saturday October 17, 2020, the herdsmen again attacked David Titus, youth leader (Kpalagbe) of Nega community under Bolki Ward, whom they shot dead on his way from Bang." Spokesperson for the police in the state, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, confirmed the incident, saying, "The Commissioner of Police, Olugbenga Adeyanju, has directed an investigation into the matter."
