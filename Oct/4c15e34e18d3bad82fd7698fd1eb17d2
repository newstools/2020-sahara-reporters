We cannot sustain the idea that the voice of the African youth is not to be heard.   We are not going to be leaders tomorrow, we are leaders already. Leaders lead with vision and broad perspective. #ENDSARS is a beachhead. The war is bigger. Have a clear picture of a developed Nigeria. Push for a change in values and in the power equation.   The mean age in Africa is 19.5 years, but the mean age of Presidents is 62 years (The Brookings Institution, Foresight Africa Report 2019). We need interpreters between the generations. The world has changed and political leaders need to know this and to lead with good advice.   Creating or providing these require courageous leadership. Letâs do it. God bless Nigeria. God bless Africa. #ENDSARS  See Also
