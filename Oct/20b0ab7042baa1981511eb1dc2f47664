Human rights activist and lawyer, Ms Ayo Obe, has tackled former Deputy Senate President of the Nigerian Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, for not acting on the police reform bill received by the Senate in 2012. Obe, who was the then President of Nigeriaâ€™s foremost civil society group, the Civil Liberties Organisation, challenged Ekweremadu when the former Deputy Senate President reacted to the ongoing protest against police brutality in the country. Ike Ekweremadu Ekweremadu tweeted that Nigerians are tired of the excesses of the police meant to protect citizens. He also claimed that the condition of the police made him move the bill for the creation of state police but lamented that the bill hasn't received the requisite political support.  2. and the excesses of those that should protect lives and property. The problem with our policing and the attendant insecurity and excesses can be located in Sections 214 (1) and 215 (2) of1999 Constitution, which provides for a unitary police and an IGP to oversea Nigeria...  Reacting to the tweet by Ekweremadu, Obe asked him what the Senate did with the bill when it was brought before it.  As Deputy Senate President, in 2012 you received the CSO Report on Police Reform on behalf of President Goodluck Jonathan.What did you do with it?  Like Obe, millions of Nigerians are raising questions over the government's failure to address this issue, which analysts say is the root cause of corruption and indiscipline in the Nigeria Police Force.
