"The commissioner said that any policeman who deviates from the normal ethics and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the Nigeria Police within the state would be arrested," Adejobi said. Adejobi said that Odumosu urged members of the public to identify and report police officers who harass, brutalise and extort them. "Such identification is sine-qua-non to immediate investigation and disciplinary actions against the erring personnel," the News Agency of Nigeria quoted the police officer to have said.
