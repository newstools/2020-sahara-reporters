The Lagos State Government has disabled the Lagos State Security Trust Fund website showing government activities with the Nigerian Army and other security agencies in the state. LSSTF was established by a former governor of the state, Babatunde Fashola, in 2007 to provide additional equipment and logistics support to under-funded security agencies operating in the state.  A check on the website, lsstf.lagosstate.gov.ng on Tuesday showed that it had been disabled. This comes less than 24 hours after Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said CCTV footage showed that men in Nigerian Army uniforms were responsible for the killing of over 10 peaceful protesters at Lekki Toll Gate area of the city.
