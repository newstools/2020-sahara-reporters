More than 20 hours after thugs and security operatives massacred peaceful protesters across Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, are yet to address the country. Buhari has only spoken in a short clip on Twitter since the nationwide protest began more than one week ago while Osinbajo made a series of tweets apologising to Nigerians for failing to curb the excesses of the police.  There is currently tension in many parts of the country at the moment.
