The Wakilin Raya Kasar Zazzau, Aminu Yakubu Wambai, has resigned his appointment less than 24 hours after Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State announced Alhaji Ahmed Bamali as the new Emir of Zazzau to succeed the late Shehu Idris. In a letter to the Secretary of the Zazzau emirate on Wednesday, Wambai said his resignation was based on his conviction to step aside from palace activities and concentrate on his numerous personal activities.  “I write to express gratitude to Allah Subahanahu Wata’ala for making me to be appointed to the position, as well as to say my pleasure for enabling me to serve creditably well to best of my ability and loyalty for the period of 19 years from Friday, 21st June, 2001 to date. “I am beset, humbly conscious of my enthusiasts to convey to you my resolve to resign my appointment as the 7th Wakilin Raya Kasar Zazzau, as well as a Permanent Zazzau Emirate Council member representing Kaduna North and Kaduna South local government areas of Kaduna State, with effect from today 7th October, 2020,” he said.  SaharaReporters gathered that a lot of Kaduna residents are not happy with the way Governor el-Rufai handled the selection process. Recall that Bamali’s name was not included in the first kingmakers’ list of three candidates submitted to the governor from among whom he was expected to approve one as new emir. El-Rufai, however, rejected the three candidates submitted to him to choose from, and later ordered for a fresh list accommodating the remaining aspirants to the stool. The three candidates earlier nominated by the kingmakers were the Yariman Zazzau, Munir Jaafaru, from the Bari Bari Ruling House; the Iyan Zazzau, Bashir Aminu, from Katsina Ruling House; and the eldest son of the immediate past emir, the Turakin Zazzau, Aminu Idris, also from Katsina Ruling House.
