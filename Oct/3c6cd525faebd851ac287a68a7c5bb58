Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria have resumed the protest for the call to release their leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, and wife, Zeenat, who have been in custody for more than five years. Despite being proscribed by the Nigerian Government, the Shiites have vowed not to stop the call for the release of El-Zakzaky.  The Shiites moved round the city chanting, “Free our leader, free Zakzaky”. They also stressed the need for El-Zakzaky to access medical treatment due to his failing health. See Also

1 Month Ago The IMN said the protest was to commemorate the fifth anniversary of their clash with the military in Zaria, Kaduna State, which led to the arrest of El-Zakzaky. In a previous protest at the Federal Capital territory, the IMN vowed not to be intimidated by the actions of the police, saying they will continue to march until Zakzaky was freed. “We are at the same time we call for the unconditional release of our leader Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenah. “We will continue to protest in Abuja no matter the attack and arrest by the authorities until the Sheikh, his wife and others in detention since December 2015 are set free,” the group said. Recall that the 2015 clash led to the massacre of over 350 IMN members by the Nigerian Army. The corpses were buried in unmarked graves by the military.
