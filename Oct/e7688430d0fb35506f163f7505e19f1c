He said, “The one that was beaten was out of professional misconduct of that officer. Even if he is a protester, he has his rights, not to talk of a journalist doing his lawful duty. “He is a Nigerian and has the right to do that and even if he has done anything against the law, is that the procedure of the police? Is that the professional way of arresting somebody and making them face the law? No. “That is not the procedure in law and it is completely unprofessional and action will be taken against that this evening. So, once again I sincerely apologise for that.” The protesters – many of whom were arrested by the police – are demanding for better governance from the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
