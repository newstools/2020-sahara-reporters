In a statement, Osarodion Ogie, Secretary to the State Government, said the curfew will remain across the state “till further notice”. Ogie said hoodlums have hijacked the #EndSARS protest and the government would not allow continuous attacks. “The curfew is to take effect from 4:00pm, October 19, 2020. This decision has become necessary because of the very disturbing incidents of vandalism and attacks on private individuals and institutions by hoodlums in the guise of #ENDSARS protesters,” the statement reads.
