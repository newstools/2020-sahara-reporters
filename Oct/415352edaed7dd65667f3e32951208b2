Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre, Sam Adeyemi, has said that Nigeriansâ€™ lives might not improve if the country finally breaks up or restructures. According to Adeyemi on his verified Twitter handle, the culture of leadership that makes leaders to consume most of the resources and to leave most people impoverished will likely continue. Sam Adeyemi  2.The first restructuring we need, and this is true for much of Africa, is for power to shift from political leaders to the citizens, so leaders become accountable, citizens have esteem and are empowered to prosper, and occupying public office is for service, not money-making.   4. Citizens and elite that have conscience must push for this now. Perhaps, then, new structures of government can serve us well. We need to show that the African can rise above base instincts to think, organise himself and build prosperous economies.
