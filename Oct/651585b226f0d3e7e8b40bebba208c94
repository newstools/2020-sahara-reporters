Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos State, has said that he has not spoken to President Muhammadu Buhari since the Lekki shootings by men of the Nigerian Army. Sanwo-Olu said he tried to call Buhari twice but was unable to reach him.  The governor made the revelation on Thursday while speaking with Arise TV in Lagos. He said, “I made phone calls to the president throughout this week, twice yesterday first time he hadn't come to the office and the second time I was at the FEC meeting so I did, I haven’t spoken to him directly but I actually did call to want to speak to him but like I said he was at FEC meeting and probably had his briefing. “He was the one that asked the Chief of Defence Staff to call me and I think it was when he got my message. He (CDS) said to me, that it was the President that asked him to call. I don’t have a report to say. We haven’t spoken.”
