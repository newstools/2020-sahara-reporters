Nigerians gathered in their numbers to hold a candlelight procession for victims of extrajudicial killings by officers of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police Force. The procession was done at Trafalgar Square in London, United Kingdom, to honour persons, who had died from the brutality of SARS personnel.  Nigerians at the procession echoed the need for police reforms in the country. The #ENDSARS protest continues to gain momentum in Nigeria and outside the country as citizens call for the prosecution of police officers involved in extrajudicial killings.
