A former spokesperson for the Nigerian Army, Sani Usman, says soldiers only fired blank bullets at #EndSARS protesters in Lekki, not live ammunition as reported. He made the claim on Thursday during a programme on Arise Television.  Usman said contrary to the social media posts that many protesters were killed in the incident, the blank ammunition used was not capable of killing anyone. He said there were enough reasons for the involvement and invitation of the military in the protest, citing reports of violence in parts of the state as a justification. He accused the Amnesty International of politicising the issue and lying against the military. "If you look at the canisters, they were blank ammo, and blank ammo doesn't even kill," he said. "At a close range, maybe 100-metres, it will have some pigmentation on your skin. Let's leave the commission of enquiry to do its job.
