Following the killings of an unconfirmed number of #EndSARS protesters by soldiers in Lagos, some Nigerians on social media have attacked Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for being silent and for his role in the government. Security operatives had on Tuesday evening opened fire on the protesters at the Lekki toll plaza.  The incident had generated an uproar within and outside the country. Many Nigerians have taken to Twitter to express their disappointment with the conduct of Osinbajo in the whole scenario, asking him how he sleeps at night.
