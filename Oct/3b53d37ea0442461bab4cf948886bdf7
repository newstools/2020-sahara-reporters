Armed thugs have overrun a popular business district in Jos, Plateau State, unleashing mayhem in the area. #EndSARS protesters were not in the area and had never protested there since demonstrations against police brutality began in the state, SaharaReporters can confirm.  The thugs in an attempt to discredit peaceful protesters took over Ahmadu Bello Way, chanting “Sai Buhari”. A restaurant, Mr Biggs, has been destroyed while cars of customers parked outside the building have been razed by the thugs. It is unclear if there are casualties at the time of this report.
