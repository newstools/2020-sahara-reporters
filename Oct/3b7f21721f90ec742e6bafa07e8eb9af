A mob has razed the Divisional Police Station in Okitipupa area of Ondo State, SaharaReporters has learnt. The mob was chased away from the street by the police before they carried out the attack on Thursday afternoon.  It was also gathered that the mob attacked the Nigerian Correctional Centre in the town and freed prisoners in the facility. A resident of the town, Mr Iyiola Okeriola, told SaharaReporters that the mob had earlier razed Okitipupa Local Government secretariat during the attack. He said, â€œThe policemen were trying to enforce curfew in the town when the mob got enraged and went to the station and set it ablaze. "Some thugs who have political motivation have hijacked the protests and are currently fomenting trouble." Not less than 50 motorcycles seized by the police and parked in the station were released by the mob. This comes less than a day after some angry youth attacked another police station in Akure and set the facility on fire. Another set of angry citizens had earlier destroyed the Special Anti-Robbery Squad facility along Oda Road in Akure, the state capital. Tee-Leo Ikoro, spokesperson for the Ondo State Police Command, who confirmed the attack, said the police are yet to estimate the total value of items damaged during the attack.
