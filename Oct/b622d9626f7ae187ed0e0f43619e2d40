There was pandemonium on Monday evening in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, after a truck allegedly crushed two #EndSARS protesters to death. SaharaReporters gathered that the incident happened at Dallimore/Christ School area of town.  This, according to an eyewitness, led to the burning of three trucks by irate youth. Protesters across Nigeria have been demanding police reforms for over a week with the #EndSARS hashtag. The government responded by dissolving the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad but the protesters are demanding the arrest and prosecution of police officers, who have killed scores of young Nigerians in recent times.
