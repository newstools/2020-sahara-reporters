The Ebute Meta Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos on Friday remanded seven men at the Ikoyi Custodial Centre for allegedly gang-raping a minor. The men, who allegedly gang-raped an 11-year-old girl to death are Ajom Tabi, 37; Omobolanle Olowookere, 41; Aliu Bilyamin, 24; Emmanuel Okon, 24; Bolarinwa Olamilekan, 24; Badmus Abdulateef, 20; Azeez Quadri, 22; and Sunday Odunayo, 22. The police preferred a three-count charge of rape, murder and defilement against the suspects. Chief Magistrate O.G. Oghre did not take the plea of the suspects pending legal advice. She ordered the police to return the case file to the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions. The magistrate, however, admitted Olowookere (the second suspect) to bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties each in like sum after her counsel, Spurgeon Ataene, told the court of her non- involvement in the case. The magistrate adjourned the case until November 18 pending legal advice.
