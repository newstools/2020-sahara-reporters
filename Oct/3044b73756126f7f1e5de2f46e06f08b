Nigerians on Saturday in Abuja trooped out to the streets to demand the scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigeria Police, over the continued brutality, torture, harassment and extrajudicial killing of Nigerians. The protesters also vowed not to back down on their demand until the Nigerian Government scrapped the unit.
