The Lekki-Epe Expressway in Lagos and surrounding areas are currently experiencing gridlock after anti-police brutality protesters cordoned off the Lekki Toll Gate. The protesters are demanding an executive order outlawing the Special Anti-Robbery Squad unit of the Nigeria Police Force, the unconditional release of all detained protesters, punishment for erring officers as well as compensation for families of victims of police brutality in the country.
