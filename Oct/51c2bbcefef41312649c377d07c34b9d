Nigerians are angry with President Muhammadu Buhari and Bola Tinubu, national leader of the All Progressives Congress, following the killings of an unconfirmed number of people by security operatives at Lekki Toll Gate, Lagos. SaharaReporters gathered that the unarmed protesters were at the tollgate singing the national anthem before soldiers opened fire on them, according to the videos that circulated online. Hours after the incident, the Presidency has yet to release a statement to condemn the barbaric act.  Some Nigerians on social media have accused Buhari and Tinubu of being involved in the killings. Here are some comments gathered by SaharaReporters from Twitter: @OlaDavis; "How did Bola Tinubu manage to wield so much power in Nigeria? How did he become so untouchable? 50% of the toll revenue probably goes to him, and you decided to kill people because of money. Money that isn't yours. ‪#EndTinubu‬ ‪#EndBuhari‬ ‪#EndThemAll.”‬  How did Bola Tinubu manage to wield so much power in Nigeria?
