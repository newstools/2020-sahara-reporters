He ordered the Deputy Majority Leader to summon an emergency meeting for Friday (today) just to prove that he wasn't detained overnight. Messages were sent to members of the Assembly of the emergency meeting at about 11:30pm on Thursday. The Assembly had initially adjourned sitting until next week Monday after its session on Wednesday over fears that Obasa might be detained beyond Thursday. Insider sources told SaharaRepoters that the case of embezzlement against the Lagos Assembly Speaker will take "very interesting shape" in the coming days especially after confessions of financial misappropriation by some members of the parliament.
