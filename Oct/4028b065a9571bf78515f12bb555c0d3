3 Days Ago Over the past few days, there have been renewed calls for the scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police Force over reports of brutality and extrajudicial killings. Following the protests, Mohammed Adamu, Inspector-General of Police, had disbanded SARS on Sunday. President Muhammadu Buhari had also issued a directive calling for a reform of the police in the country. However, the protests have continued with activists issuing a five-point demand including the release of all persons arrested and justice for victims of police brutality.
