Rights organisation, Amnesty International, has asked the Nigerian authorities to stop trying to cover up the killing of peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate area of Lagos on October 20. AI in a series of tweets on Wednesday said many questions remained unanswered and government's position has continued to change regarding the incident.  The tweets reads, “The Nigerian authorities’ must end their attempts to cover up the Lekki Toll Gate massacre, Amnesty International said, as it released a new timeline investigating the atrocity one week later. #LekkiTollGateShooting  The Nigerian authoritiesâ must end their attempts to cover up the Lekki Toll Gate massacre, Amnesty International said, as it released a new timeline investigating the atrocity one week later. #LekkiTollGateShooting   Nigerian authorities still have many questions to answer: who ordered the use of lethal force on peaceful protesters? Why were CCTV cameras on the scene dismantled in advance? And who ordered electricity turned off minutes before the military opened fire on protesters?   The initial denials of the involvement of soldiers in the shooting was followed by the shameful denial of the loss of lives as a result of the militaryâs attack against the protests. #LekkiTollGateShooting   Many people are still missing since the day of the incident, and credible evidence shows that the military prevented ambulances from reaching the severely injured in the aftermath. #LekkiTollGateShooting   Amnesty International is still investigating the shooting, and the reported removal of bodies of those killed by the military in an attempt to remove evidence. #LekkiTollGateShooting
