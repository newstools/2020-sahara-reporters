#EndSars protesters in Abuja have vowed to camp outside the Nigeria Police Force headquarters until the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, addresses them. The angry protesters stormed the policy facility on Saturday morning in continuation of their agitation for the Nigerian Government to scrap the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, which has become a thorn in the flesh of innocent citizens.  Trouble started when a senior police officer came out to address the crowd but was rebuffed by the protesters, who interrupted him and demanded to see the IGP.  The officer had told them that the IGP was not around to receive them but promised to deliver their message to him. See Also

Recall that the police on Friday chased and teargassed some of the demonstrators at the Central Area of Abuja, a situation that compelled youths to turn out in large numbers on Saturday to call for the disbandment of SARS.
