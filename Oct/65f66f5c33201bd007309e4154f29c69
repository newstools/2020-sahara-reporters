Nigerians in South Africa have resolved to join the ongoing #ENDSARS protest in the country. Hundreds of Nigerians living in South Africa will gather on Wednesday, October 21, 2020, for a peaceful march to the High Commission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Pretoria.  The protest is to further call on the Nigerian Government to yield to the demands of citizens to put an end to police brutality in the country. The protesters will converge on Pretoria Art Museum, Pretoria, where they will march to the Nigerian High Commission. One of the organisers of the protest said that the Nigerian Government had not done enough in dealing with the agitations of the people. "We have been following the protest with keen interest to see what direction the Nigerian Government will follow. "But unsatisfied with the government's response and pace in dealing with the issue, we deem it fit as Nigerians based in South Africa to join our voices and further put pressure on the Nigerian Government to meet the demands of millions of Nigerian youth all over the world," one of the leaders of the protest in South Africa said. The peaceful #ENDSARS protest has entered its third week in Nigeria. The protest has spread to different states in the country as well as outside the shores of the country including Ghana, Germany, France, United States of America and the United Kingdom.
