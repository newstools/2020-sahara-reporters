The management of Lekki Concession Company Limited has denied involvement in the shooting of unarmed protesters by the Nigerian Army on Tuesday night. The company attributed its inability to restore power to the Lekki Toll Gate on the curfew imposed by the Lagos State Government.  SaharaReporters had reported how the army opened fire on peaceful #ENDSARS protesters, killing over 10 of them in the process and leaving dozens others terribly injured. Before the shooting started, power at the Lekki Toll Gate, convergence point of the protest, was switched off while the Closed Circuit Television monitoring activities at the venue was removed. However, the LCC said it had always supported the protest and would never condone the shooting of unarmed protesters. Explaining why power was off, the company said, "LCC receives power from the IPP grid, the power albeit stable is taken off from time to time. "At such times, LCC relies on the backup generators for power supply. However, following the declaration of the curfew by the state governor, LCC withdrew all her staff from the office locations. "This is the reason why the lights could not be restored when the mains from IPP went off temporarily. This is verifiable." Hours before the killing of peaceful protesters by the Nigerian Army, some men were captured on camera removing the CCTV installed at the Lekki Toll Gate plaza. Immediately nightfall swept across the area on that fateful Tuesday, the street lighting around the place went off and minutes later, soldiers moved in to hack innocent citizens to death. Nigerians, enraged by that incident, have accused the LCC, Lagos State Government and federal authorities of being behind the massacre.
