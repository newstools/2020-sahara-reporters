Adamu said, “The unity of this country lies in the support that is given to police officers because if you are demoralised, the tendency is for criminals to take over the public space and the country is relying on us to make sure that the public space is not taken over by the criminals. So no amount of provocation, no amount of insult would make us shy away from our responsibilities. “Inasmuch as we are aware that the government is behind us; so, we would encourage you to keep performing your duties. We would encourage you to be professional, to be civic, but if anybody touches you, if anybody comes to assault you, you can also protect yourself. “When we talk of human rights, the police are human; so, the rights of police officers would also be protected.” He added that the police was sending legal messages to all Nigerians that officers had the right to protect themselves in order not to be endangered.
