Staff of Channels Television have been forced to escape for their lives as a mob invaded the broadcast station on Wednesday morning. Angry thugs have been destroying government properties after armed security officers opened fire and killed peaceful protesters at Lekki, Lagos, on Tuesday night. Channels Television has since gone off-air.  A mob earlier attacked and set fire to Television Continental believed to be owned by Bola Tinubu, former Lagos State governor. The Nigeria Ports Authority, Lagos, and the Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge toll plaza have also been burnt. The situation has spilled tension all across Lagos and beyond where citizens are continuing to demand an end to police brutality and improved governance in Nigeria.
