The Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, in his presidential speech to mark the 60th independence of the nation shaded his predecessors, claiming they presided over the near destruction of the country. Buhari in his speech also boasted that “no government in the past did what we are doing with such scarce resources” and that “we have managed to keep things going despite the disproportionate spending on security.”  In his attack on previous governments, Buhari said; “Those in the previous governments, from 1999 – 2015, who presided over the near destruction of the country, have now the impudence to attempt to criticise our efforts”. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo served as the Nigerian president between 1999 and 2007 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Umaru Musa Yar’Adua succeeded Obasanjo in 2007 but was unable to complete his first term tenure. He died in office 5th May 2010. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who was the vice to Yar’Adua, was sworn in as the president 6th May 2010 following the demise of Yar’Adua. He also won the 2011 presidential election and served till 2015. President Muhammadu Buhari defeated Jonathan in the 2015 election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
