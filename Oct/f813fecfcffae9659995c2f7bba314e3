He said many cattle were taken away by the gunmen, stressing that there was no intervention from any security operative in the area. “Bandits again attacked our village last night and killed my father’s elder brother. They also kidnapped 15 persons and have started demanding for ransom. “It’s so sad, as soon as it’s 6pm, you can’t find any security operative in this area. They would have all gone back to Gusau which is about 130km from here,” the source told SaharaReporters.
