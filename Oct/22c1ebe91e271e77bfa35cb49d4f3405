No fewer than three persons lost their lives in Dutse Makaranta under Bwari Area Council of Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, on Tuesday when violence erupted. Also, a police station was set ablaze by suspected thugs in the city.  It was gathered that the situation was under control and peaceful until the arrival of a team of policemen in four trucks, who opened fire on the suspected thugs, leaving three of them dead. The action forced the thugs to set the station on fire in retaliation. The incident led to commotion in the area as parents rushed to schools to pick their wards to avoid being caught up in the crisis. This comes shortly after the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, ordered the deployment of riot policemen nationwide to protect lives and property.  The IGP also deployed policemen to strengthen security around custodial facilities nationwide.
