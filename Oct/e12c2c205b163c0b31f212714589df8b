Channels Television, one of Nigeria’s biggest news organisations, on Friday evening put out a post on Twitter claiming that the protest against police brutality in Nigeria had ended, causing confusion about the true picture of things. The tweet, which was sent out with a short video, said, “The 72-hour Lagos #EndSars protest has officially ended. But the conveners say they are not backing down until the government scraps the infamous police unit.”  The 72 Hours Lagos #EndSars protest has officially ended.

Mobilisers under the EndSAR’s hashtag on Twitter are actively planning demonstrations all over Lagos, Abuja, Enugu, Port Harcourt and other cities around the country for as early as Saturday. In Lagos, while protest went on overnight, more demonstrators were expected to converge on the Lagos State House of Assembly, Alausa, and Lekki Toll Gate among other locations around the city.  #EndSARS Protesters To Spend Third Night Outside Lagos Assembly | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/sRBW4F5ImL pic.twitter.com/lFbiv1QP5G  In Abuja, two protests are scheduled for Saturday -- one at 7:00am at Berger and another at the same time starting from Games Village Roundabout near Gudu Area.
