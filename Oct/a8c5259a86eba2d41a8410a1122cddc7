Youths in Osun State have trooped out to join the nationwide #ENDSARS protest. The youth joined the three-day protest to push for the scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police Force.  The call came following recent clamour to end extra-judicial activities and killings by operatives of SARS.  Protesters will be marching to the police headquarters to make the call for the scrapping of SARS and the reform of the police.  The protesters held placards with various inscriptions.    The same protest is simultaneously taking place in Lagos at the police headquarters, Ikeja. See Also
