8 Hours Ago On Saturday, however, while briefing journalists outside the top medical facility, his personal physician, Col. Sean Conley, said the President tested positive for Coronavirus 72 hours ago. This timeline contradicts Trump's announcement about his positive diagnosis, which was no more than 35 hours ago. When also asked to confirm if Trump, who is at risk of complications from the virus had received oxygen, Conley was evasive. A source is quoted as saying, “The President’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery,” New York Times reports.
