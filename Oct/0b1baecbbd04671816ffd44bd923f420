2 Days Ago The protesters were granted bail on October 2 but the Chief Magistrate refused to sign their bail bond, forcing them to remain in custody since that period until Tuesday when they were eventually freed.  One of the leaders of the movement, who confirmed the release of the protesters to SaharaReporters, said, "We have secured their release, all of them have been freed and are on their way home."  The protesters, looking undeterred, promised not to be broken by the police as they urged Nigerians to join the movement to regain the country from looters.
