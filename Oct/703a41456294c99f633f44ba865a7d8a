Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has imposed a 48-hour curfew across the state to curb violence in the city. Addressing residents of the state on Thursday morning, the governor said the curfew will begin from 6:00pm today and will be reviewed further.  All public and private schools have been shut until November 2, 2020. The peaceful #EndSARS protest on Wednesday night took a violent turn in Delta State after thugs set fire to government offices and property in Asaba, the state capital.  The office of the Federal Road Safety Corps along the Benin-Asaba-Onitsha Expressway and the beautification garden at the nearby Koka Junction were set ablaze by the miscreants.  A senior FRSC official, who confirmed the development to our correspondent, said, â€œOur office has been completely razed down. As I talk to you can't pick a pin. But I thank God none of my staff was touched." Our correspondent, who visited the scene, observed that the entire office and over 15 vehicles impounded by the commission including a lorry with cement were razed by the thugs.
