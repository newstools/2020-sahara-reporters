A legal practitioner, Yusuf Temilola Nurudeen, has dragged President Muhammadu Buhari and Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to court over the killing of peaceful #ENDSARS protesters at Lekki Toll Gate. The lawyer, in the suit filed for himself and on behalf of the #ENDSARS protesters, also joined the Attorney-General of the Federation, Attorney-General of Lagos State, Nigerian Army, Nigeria Police Force, Chief of Army Staff, Inspector-General of Police, Brigadier-General Francis Omata, Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, and M. I. Yahya as the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th respondents.  In the suit before the Federal High Court, Lagos, the lawyer prayed the court to determine whether the shooting of protesters was not a violation of the rights of the protesters and whether the situation, atmosphere and conducts of the protesters have degenerated into any situation that envisaged the deployment of the army. He also asked the court to determine whether the 6th, 8th and 10th defendants have not failed in their constitutional responsibilities to provide adequate security for #ENDSARS protesters. The lawyer prayed the court to declare that the action of the defendants in forcefully dispersing and shooting at the protesters is “unjustifiable, inexcusable and not permitted, therefore, wrongful, unlawful, unconstitutional and a violation of the plaintiff’s rights to freedom of expression and right to peaceful assembly”.
