Human rights activist and co-convener of the BringBackOurGirls Movements, Aisha Yesufu, has decried the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari to address the country on the gruesome killings of at least 43 farmers in the Zabarmari area of Borno State. Yesufu on Twitter lamented that a Boko Haram leader from the Abubakar Shekau faction had addressed the country on Tuesday while the President has yet to make an address.

She said, “The leader of the terrorist group has addressed the nation while the ruler of the Federal Republic Of Nigeria has yet to address the country. The terrorists know their leader has got their back. Nigerians have no leader. This hurts!

The legislative arm of government is where we need to focus our attention for now. They have the power to checkmate the executive.

An infuriated Senate on Tuesday had called on the President to sack the service chiefs who seemed to be lacking ideas to ensure national security. The House of Representatives had also summoned the President to appear before it and answer to the killings. The Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, who seemed to have lost faith in the Nigerian armed forces, had stated on Monday that the President should engage the services of mercenaries to clear the entire Sambisa Forest.
