Some allegedly sponsored hoodlums have disrupted the #BringBackOurBoys meeting organized by the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) in Kaduna. The meeting was being held to address the prevailing insecurity in the Northern region.  Bandit had on Friday stormed Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State, abducting at least 333 students. Using the hashtag, #Bringbackourboys campaign, CNG had on Monday fixed a meeting at Arewa House in Kaduna to call the attention of the world to the high rate of insecurity in the region before hoodlums invaded the venue and disrupted the event. "Coalition of Northern Groups program on insecurity taking place in Arewa House was just attacked by hire hoodlums #Securethenorth," Daily Trust's cartoonist, Mustapha Bulama, posted on Twitter.

"Our state chapters are also embarking on a long trek to Daura in Katsina State to demand immediate action from Buhari who is currently in Daura. "The Kano CNG will take off from Dambatta in solidarity with the Katsina chapter to link up with the Jigawa contingent at Kazaure from where they will join the Kano team at Mashi and proceed on the great trek to Daura for the long wait in front of Buhari's country home. "The daring kidnap of hundreds of school children in Katsina only goes to confirm the series of warnings raised by the CNG that thousands of our fellow citizens in the north have virtually been abandoned to armed criminals and a vicious insurgency," CNG spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman said.
