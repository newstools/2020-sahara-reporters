A statement signed by the NYLF's national chairman, Elliot Afiso, counselled the APC to respect zoning arrangements in the party to ensure equity.

22 Hours Ago While acknowledging that the People's Democratic Party (PDP) lost its zoning arrangement in 2011, NYLF believed that the Northeast region deserves to produce the party's presidential candidate in 2023. "We want to state clearly that the power rotation in the PDP was dead and buried in 2011 and as such, the PDP is advised to pick its presidential candidate from the north-east if at all, the party intends to make headway and bounce to power in 2023. "On the rumoured intention and interests by the former President, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, we want to sincerely and categorically state that he should not accept any invitation to contest under any party because the north as it is now, would never vote for him no matter the indices. "In the same vein, we want to advise our elders and elites from the north-west to shelve or discontinue any interest in the presidency or vice presidency come 2023 for the interest and unity of the northern region. "The NYLF which has overwhelming membership and support from north-west has resolved not to support or vote for any party that presents her candidate from the north-west for the presidency or vice presidency."
