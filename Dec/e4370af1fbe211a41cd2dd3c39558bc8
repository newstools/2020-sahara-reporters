Instead of implementing the demands of the health workers, the state government threatened to deal with any nurse or midwife who “flouts this directive” according to the rule of engagement and extant provisions.

SaharaReporters gathered that the health workers commenced their strike on Thursday, based on a five-point demand.The strike stems from the demotion of principals of nursing and midwifery schools and the imposition of a junior nursing officer as the director of nursing services.Other issues include implementation of license community nursing and midwifery and volunteer nursing recruitment instead of actual recruitment, as well as promotion, arrears and uniform allowance of the workers.The National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives had asked their members in the state to begin the indefinite strike on Thursday.
