The Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC ) has deployed officials to badger residents to pay a wide-ranging amount for what it calls radio and television license fee.They are asking business owners in the nationâ€™s capital to pay N200,000 under this outdated and obscure taxation. The officials told residents that the payment is backed by Section 7 (fourth schedule) of the 1999 Constitution and the AMAC Radio Television Bye-Law.According to a document obtained by SaharaReporters, a big company is charged N200,000; medium: N100,000; and small company: N50,000.Duplex occupants are required to pay N20,000; flat: N10,000; bungalow: N5,000; and small apartment: N3,500. The area council officials have been threatening residents to pay the obscure fees or appear before a court. Many Abuja residents insisted that they could not afford such an amount of money at a time that they are facing financial hardship.
