The Oyo State Police Public Relations Officer, Olugbenga Fadeyi, confirmed the former lawmaker's death, stating that efforts were ongoing to arrest the assailants. Aborode and his manager were said to have been attacked, but the manager narrowly escaped death.

The victim was rushed to Olugbon hospital, Igboora, where he was confirmed dead." The development comes as a security guard, Semiu, was also killed during a robbery operation in Moniya axis of the state. Speaking on the death of Semiu, other security guards in the community said the hoodlums could have caused more harm if they had not been resisted. Residents said they woke up on Saturday to discover the corpse of the security man at the wheel alignment section in the filling station. Reports stated that sticks with bloodstains were found close to the corpse.
