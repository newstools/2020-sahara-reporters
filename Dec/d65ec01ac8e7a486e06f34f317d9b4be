A Nigerian national, Edwin Chukwudiebere Okoye, who allegedly conned a Kenya woman, Bella Bronislavia, of Sh31million (N100m) has gotten a reprieve after the Kibera Law Courts in Nairobi allowed him more time to settle the matter out of the court with the complainant. According to Nation Africa, Okoye was accused of conspiring with others to defraud Bronislavia of the said amount of money on various dates between May 1, 2017, and May 14, 2018.  The accused and his accomplices claimed the money was needed to fund a business. Okoye is also facing charges of obtaining money by pretences. He was accused of receiving Sh31million by falsely pretending that he had won a government tender that needed funding, knowing the claims he made to Bronislavia were false. The two met at B Club in Nairobi's Kilimani area and became friends, with Okoye claiming that he had some contracts. The court heard how, on other times, he would claim there were phones he wanted to introduce into the Kenya market but did not have enough money. The accused allegedly asked the complainant to lend him money promising to top up with a commission. The complainant complied by transferring various amounts of money from her bank account to that of the accused, for a total sum of Sh31million (N100m). The court was informed that since then, Okoye has never made any repayment. Subsequently, the complainant reported the matter to the police and Okoye was later arrested. When he appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Derrick Kutto at the Kibera Law Courts, Okoye claimed through a lawyer that he was negotiating with the complainant with a view of paying the money over the weekend.
