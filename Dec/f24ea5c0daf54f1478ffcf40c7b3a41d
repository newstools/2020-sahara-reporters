Are we going to remain hogtied by these evil men or are they gradually becoming part of a larger plot to seal the fate of our country?“President Buhari deliberately sacrificed the dreams of those who voted for him to what seemed like a programme to stratify and institutionalise northern hegemony.

The President may have concluded that Christians will do nothing and will live with these actions.“He may be right and we Christians cannot feel sorry that we have no pool of violence to draw from or threaten our country. However, God does not sleep. We can see from the inexplicable dilemma of his North.” See Also
