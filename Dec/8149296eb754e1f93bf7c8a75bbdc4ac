September 8, 2016, transaction was authorised from Ogun State Government Expenditure Account, which was reportedly under Amosun’s control.It was also unclear whether or not a voucher was raised for the transaction. At least two officials in Ogun State accountant-general’s office said they could not trace any payment advice before the transaction went to the President.“There is no voucher relating to any direct or indirect payment to President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016 in our filing system,” a senior civil servant at the accountant-general’s office told Peoples Gazette.“It was possible that the governor did not raise a voucher before the transaction was processed.”The officials said it was quite common during Amosun's administration for money transfers to be done directly from the state treasury without requisite documentation, especially if the governor had a direct interest in such payments.
