Did Omah Lay and Tems invite themselves to Uganda?? How do you arrest Nigerian artistes in your country over a show that they didn’t organize?? Why didn’t they postpone or cancel the show if shows weren’t allowed?” A date was fixed and announced for a show, Time and venue announced, The stage was set and the event kicked off!! The Uganda Government had enough time to cancel the show or even stop it when it started!! Why wait till later to arrest Nigerian Artistes??
