The Cyber Crime Wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) has busted a commodity scam and arrested a Nigerian suspected to be part of a syndicate made up of Nigerian nationals. According to Indi News, the accused has been identified as Fulgens Quadio, alias Kristopher Wilmer, 27, and was arrested in Mumbai.  The police said in 2019, a complainant, K. M. Joseph of Kilpauk, Chennai alleged that he had received a Facebook message from an unknown person claiming to be Elizabeth from the UK, who owned a pharmaceutical company. The so-called Elizabeth said she needed Folic oil, which would be used to cure blood cancer. She offered the complainant a business deal to export Folic oil from India and gave the contact details of a dealer/manufacturer of Folic oil in Mumbai, who was Sunitha of Star Enterprises. Believing this to be genuine, Mr. Joseph contacted Sunitha and deposited â‚¹40 lakh for exports. Later, he realised that he had been scammed and hence he lodged a complaint with the then Chennai City Police Commissioner and a case was registered by the Central Crime Branch and taken up for investigation. After investigation, a special team of police personnel arrested Fulgens Quadio, alias Kristopher Wilmer, 27, in Mumbai. He was taken to Chennai by air and produced by the special team before a court. He was remanded for 15 days. The Chennai City Cyber Crime Cell Police have advised the general public and businessmen not to invest money in this sort of commodity scams.
