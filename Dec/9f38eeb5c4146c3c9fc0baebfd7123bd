1 Day Ago However, Maina jumped bail which prompted Okon Abang, a Judge of the Federal High Court in Abuja, to order the arrest of Ali Ndume, Senator representing Borno South. Ndume had stood surety for Maina so that he could be granted bail. After about four days in custody, the court granted the legislator bail on Friday. Abang had said although other grounds of Ndume’s bail application failed, the senator has a record of “good behaviour”. The Judge asked the Borno lawmaker to produce a surety who must be a resident of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and has property in the territory.
