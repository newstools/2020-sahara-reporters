He said, “The increment has nothing to do with the satellites. They will continue to pay their N25,000 till they graduate. But the incoming students are the ones that will pay the N67,048.50. “The Governing Council has approved it of the university, and the Lagos State Government has also keyed into it. “We need to get some funds to run the university. The increment has been marginal. It is not exorbitant. Some parents and even the state government have commended the university for not skyrocketing the fees to an amount they cannot afford.”
