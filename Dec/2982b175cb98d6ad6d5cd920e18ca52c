1 Day Ago “The Lagos State Police Command wishes to re-echo and remind the general public that the Government of Lagos State, businesses, individuals and security families still groan in losses and pains that the last violent EndSARS protest occasioned. The state is still nurturing the injuries orchestrated by some violent EndSARS protesters and not fit to accommodate such protest for now. “In the light of the above, the Lagos State Police Command, therefore, warns those who might want to disguise under EndSARS protest to cause another set of mayhem, brouhaha and violence in the state, to desist from such plans as the police and other security agencies will not fold their arms, seeing individuals or groups orchestrating another violence and anarchy in the state. “The command also warns parents and guardians to warn and discourage their children and wards from being lured into any act, gathering or protest capable of causing violence in the state. The command wishes to reiterate that any unlawful gathering, procession or protest will be suppressed professionally in accordance with the provisions of the law. “The police command encourages residents and those who are in Lagos for their genuine engagements to go about their lawful businesses as all hands are on deck to maintain law and order within the length and breadth of Lagos State.” The #EndSARS protests, which engulfed the country in the first week of October through the third, were later hijacked by hoodlums leading to the destruction of properties and loss of lives.
