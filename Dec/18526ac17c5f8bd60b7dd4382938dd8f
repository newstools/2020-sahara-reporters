1 Day Ago Speaking to Channels TV, Ikileema Idris, whose son was taken, begged the Nigerian government for help. Idris said, “My son is among those kidnapped. We want the government to show political will as we overheard that the security agencies have gone and seen them eye-to-eye and come back. “We want the government to provide them with all the facilities and rescue them for us since they confessed to have seen them somewhere on the mountain with our children in the centre.” Another parent, Umma Haruna, asked Nigerians to pray for the rescue of the students. “My son is one of those kidnapped. We are appealing to the government that it should, in the name of Allah and Noble Prophet, consider our plight by rescuing our children. “We are equally appealing to our Muslim brothers to assist us with prayers to see that our children are rescued safely,” she said.
