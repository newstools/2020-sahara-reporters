Northern elders, under the aegis of Coalition of Northern Elders for Peace and Development, on Monday, said Friday’s attack on Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, in Katsina State, has provided another justification for President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the service chiefs immediately. The group, in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Engr. Zana Goni, and National Women Leader, Hajiya Mario Bichi, said the attack had further confirmed their position that the region was at the mercy of terrorists, bandits, and other criminal elements.  The group pointed out that the continuous stay in office of the service chiefs was emboldening the adversaries in their increasing dastardly actions against the country. Noting that the attack on school children was callous and reprehensible, the group advised the government to seek foreign help in addressing the nation’s security problem once and for all. The statement read, “The latest attack on Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, in Katsina State, where over 333 children are reportedly missing has further confirmed our position that our region is now at the mercy of terrorists, bandits and other criminal elements. ”As a result of this, we firmly believe that time has come for our president to bring in fresh hope and clear directions on how best the country would strategize to overcome the present insecurity situation in the country in general. “At the boiling point, we have found ourselves in today, we firmly believe that it will not be out of place to seek assistance in dealing with these threats from outside. “Nigerians elected our president and the same Nigerians have spoken through their representatives in the National Assembly. Our president should listen to them by dropping the service chiefs, who have since reached retirement age in the military and appoint new ones with fresh ideas to do the job for which we elected him to do.”
