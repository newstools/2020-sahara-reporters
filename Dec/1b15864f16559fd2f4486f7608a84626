A source, who spoke to SaharaReporters, said not less than 20 students sustained wounds from gunshots and machete after thugs loyal to a factional coordinator of the association in Zone D (Southwest) began attacking delegates. He said, “They have stopped accreditation already, you know we have factions in Zone D. If you see the boys one of the coordinators brought to the convention ground, even the DSS ran away.” BREAKING: Sporadic gunshots rocks the ongoing #NANS Convention venue in Abuja amidst vote buying.
