The Peoples Democratic Party caucus in the House of Representatives has, again, called for the impeachment of the President Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), especially over the abduction of over 300 schoolboys in Kankara, Katsina State. The caucus had recently urged Nigerians to prevail on the National Assembly to begin an impeachment process against Buhari over the killing of 43 rice farmers by Boko Haram in Borno State.  Chairman of the House Committee on Media and Publicity, Benjamin Kalu, had dismissed the call as an unpopular opinion of only the factional opposition leader, Kingsley Chinda. But at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday, Chinda restated the call for the impeachment of the President over the growing insecurity in the country. Other PDP members in the House accompanied Chinda, Punch reports.
