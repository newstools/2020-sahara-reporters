The Federal Government on Saturday released six prisoners repatriated from Thailand to complete their prison terms in Nigeria but held in Kirikiri Maximum Prison many years beyond their release dates. The released inmates are Azukaeme Henry Ejikeme, George Chibuike Onyeama, Kennedy Tanya, Yakubu Yahuza Mohammed, Mrs Gloria Ogbonna and Wasiu Amusan, alias John Smith.  Documents seen by SaharaReporters showed that the six were imprisoned for drug-related offences but were granted royal pardon and their sentences commuted by the Thai monarch, Maha Vajiralongkorn, to one-sixth of their original sentences. Making a case for the released inmates, human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, had in a letter in August 2020 to the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, alleged that the Nigerian government was wasting public funds maintaining them when they ought to have regained their freedom. “Our clients were convicted in Thailand for drug-related offences at various times between 1998 and 2006. They were however transferred from Thailand to the Kirikiri Maximum Correctional Centre to complete their prison terms following the Prison Exchange Treaty of 2012 between the Kingdom of Thailand and the Federal Government of Nigeria. Section 5 of the said Prison Exchange Treaty stipulates that the transferring state i.e. Thailand 'shall retain exclusive jurisdiction regarding the judgments of it's court, the sentences imposed by them and any procedures for revision, modification or cancellation of those judgments and sentences,'” Falana said. “Pursuant to the said treaty, our clients were granted general amnesty under the Thai Royal Amnesty Decree in 2016 and 2919. But due to undisclosed reasons the authorities of the Nigerian Correctional Services have refused to release our clients from unlawful incarceration notwithstanding that they have been pardoned under the Thai Royal Amnesty Decree. However, having obtained copies of the Royal Amnesty documents from the Government of Thailand through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we are pained to know our clients ought to have been released from prison custody at various times between 2010 and 2019. “It is evident that the Federal Government which facilitated the transfer of our clients from Thailand to Nigeria has abandoned them in the Kirikiri Maximum Correctional Centre. Thus, due to unpardonable negligence of certain public officers, the Federal Government has been wasting public funds on maintaining our clients when they ought to have regained their freedom. We are therefore compelled to draw your attention to the facts and circumstances of the conviction, sentences and the royal pardon granted to our clients which are briefly set out below: “Mr Azukaeme Henry Ejikeme was convicted and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment in 2006.
