Two workers in a Lagos State-based company, Francis Obeya and Emanuel Abah, have been arrested by the police in Ogun State on Christmas Day, while stealing and escaping with the company’s goods. The two suspects were apprehended by the Ogbere division of the Ogun State Police Command after the company called the police.  According to the command’s spokesperson, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, the suspects would soon be arraigned in court. He said, “Two men, Francis Obeya, 26; and Emmanuel Abah, 21; were on the early hours of Friday, December 25, 2020, arrested by operatives of the Ogun State Police Command while fleeing with a motorcycle belonging to their employer's company. “The suspects were arrested following a distress call received from a Lagos-based company at the command's control room that a dispatch rider with the company was sent to deliver certain goods to a client, but he went away with the goods and the motorcycle.
