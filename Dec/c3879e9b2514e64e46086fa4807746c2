0 Comments
23 Hours Ago Following the bloody invasion, the council chairman, Itiako Constantine Ikpokpo, on Friday, imposed a 24-hour curfew on the two warring communities and suspended the payment of salaries of traditional rulers in both communities. These measures were among other resolutions reached by the Isoko South Local Government Security Council after an emergency security meeting over the crisis. The security council also recommended to the state government the withdrawal of staff of the office of the traditional ruler of Igbide, Edward Obukeni 1, and that of Emede, Johnson Omote Ewhiri 11, while the government should no longer recognise the President generals of both communities. The council, however, declared the President general of the Igbide community wanted. He is currently at large.
