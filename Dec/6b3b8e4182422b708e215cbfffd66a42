The deputy governor, in a PDP Elders Steering Committee report submitted to the governor, a copy of which was made available to SaharaReporters, said the governor had completely forgotten about the promises he made to him during the election. The Oke-Ogun born deputy governor lamented that the governor only gave him few portfolios since he assumed office. He wondered why a former senator, Agboola Halleluyah, is more relevant in the government than himself who is constitutionally number two citizen of the state. The report partly reads, "Olaniyan complained bitterly about being oblivious about the running of the government. He said the governor has completely forgotten about the promises he made to him during the election. "He said that the governor had treated him in the most unfair, unjust and the most unkind manner. He complained that the governor only gave him a few portfolios and he has not given him more since then. He also feels that Senator Agboola Halleluyah is more relevant than him in the government."
