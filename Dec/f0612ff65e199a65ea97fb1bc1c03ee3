he Peoples Democratic Party caucus in the House of Representatives has called on Nigerians to compel their representatives in the National Assembly to immediately commence impeachment proceedings against the President Muhammadu Buhari, for "gross incompetence and persistent and continuous breach of Section 14(2) (b) of the 1999 Constitution." The section partly reads, "The security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government; â€¦" President Buhari The caucus also called on members of the Federal Executive Council to invoke the provisions of Section 144 (1) of the Constitution by declaring that Buhari was incapable of discharging the functions of the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Leader of the PDP caucus, Kingsley Chinda, in a statement in Abuja on Saturday, titled, 'PDP caucus mourns, says Nigeria saddled with the circus', said it was disheartening to the caucus that the President had failed to lead Nigerians from the front as he promised. "Nigerians are daily and defencelessly killed by terrorists and bandits, while public officers are freely bleeding the economy," he said. Chinda, while reacting to the killing of 43 rice farmers in Zambarmari area of Borno State, said the reactions from the Presidency and the military to such killings "highlight a certain crassness and lame-duck attitude that has for the past five years come to define the Buhari presidency." He said the greater worry for the country, however, was the "do-nothing posturing and the effeminate reactions of the Presidency and the military that follow the dastardly attacks." Chinda said, "The PDP caucus in the House of Representatives has observed with deep pain the dastardly attacks on poor farmers, which have continued unabated across the vast swathes of northern Nigeria, which act came to a sad climax over the weekend in Zabarmari, near Maiduguri, North-East He said from Buni Yadi, Gamboru, Baga, Gwoza, Shiroro, Konduga, Kawuri, Southern Kaduna to Benue and "certainly, everywhere else in Nigeria, lives were being snatched by insurgents, bandits and kidnappers, who have no respect for the sanChinda further said in part, "While President Buhari idles in the typical fashion of Emperor Nero as our country burns, questions must be asked abou "We call on Nigerians across tribes, religions and political parties to wake up their National Assembly members and compel them to commence impeachment process against President Buhari to save Nigeria."
