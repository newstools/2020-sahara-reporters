Some Nigerians have taken to the social media to demand justice for Don David, an 11-year-old junior secondary school student. He was allegedly molested by his seniors at Deeper Life High School, Uyo Campus in Akwa Ibom State. A Twitter hashtag #JusticeForDonDavid has been trending with many calling on relevant authorities to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. FR The development comes after the victim's mother, Deborah Okezie, went live on Facebook to share her pains about the health of her son, whom she said had just returned from the school on Friday. This has generated mixed reactions on social media as some Nigerians were calling for justice while others insisted that both sides of the story must be heard.
