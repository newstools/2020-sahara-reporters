Two of them went into the house and the other one who stood at the entrance asked the man to run away. “When he left the place, he ran towards some security operatives and told them what was happening in the village, but instead of them to go and confront the gunmen, they asked the man to stay with them till day break,” a villager said. On December 11, 2020, some bandits kidnapped 344 students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State. They were released about a week later.
