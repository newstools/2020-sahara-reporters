The office of the Ghana Electoral Commission in the Fomena Constituency was razed by fire in the early hours of Tuesday. The cause of the fire is unclear, but reports suggest it happened at the time some youth in the area were very agitated. Fire service personnel were there to control the situation
GhanaWeb According to GhanaWeb, it was discovered that some disgruntled youth had attempted to enter the Coalition Centre because they had received information the commission was about to declare the results. Security officers at post, according to reports, intervened. JoyNews reporter, Nana Yaw Gyimah, reports that the office, which is about 200 metres away from the coalition centre, was later engulfed by fire. The incident has been brought under control as the fire service has succeeded in dousing the flame. Fomena Constituency has been in the spotlight after the incumbent Member of Parliament, Andrews Asiamah, who was on the ticket of the New Patriotic Party, decided to contest as an independent candidate. Asiamah made the decision after he lost the party's parliamentary primaries to Philip Ofori Asante. The legislator ignored attempts by the party to get him to rescind his decision, a posture President Nana Akufo-Addo was unhappy about. Meanwhile, certified results say Mr Asiamah has won the contest. Philip Ofori Asante of the NPP is said to have polled 10,798. Christina Ama of the NDC polled 2,608. Appiagyei Eric had 158 votes while Andrews Asiamah garnered 12,805.
