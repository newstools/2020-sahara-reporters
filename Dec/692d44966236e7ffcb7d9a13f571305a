Deborah Okezie, mother of 11-year-old pupil of Deeper Life High School, Don-Davis Archibong, who was allegedly assaulted in the school, has claimed she has audio recordings of what transpired in the state Commissioner of Education's office. Okezie had earlier stated on a Facebook live session that she was intimidated in the commissioner's office.  She said one of her phones was collected from her and the commissioner asked her to remove a video she had posted from the Internet. Okezie also claimed that she was pushed out of the commissioner's office. But the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Comrade Iniobong Ememobong, in a Vanguard report on Wednesday, said all of Okezie's allegations regarding what happened in the commissioner's office were lies. Speaking with SaharaReporters on Wednesday, Okezie, however, claimed she still had the audio recording of the incident which she said she would release to the public at the right time. Okezie had on Tuesday stated that her son's medical report was ready and would also be made available to the public 'at the appropriate time'.
