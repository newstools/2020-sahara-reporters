The United States on Friday donated a shipment of surveillance equipment to the Nigerian Navy in Lagos State, saying the maritime security equipment would help to secure the maritime environment and fight crimes. The equipment, worth $180,000, would help to upgrade the anti-piracy and nautical security functions of the country’s Regional Maritime Awareness Capability. According to the US Mission in Nigeria in a statement on Friday, the security equipment comprises a “selection of best-in-class sensors and radars, communications and networking equipment, thermal-imaging cameras and software, which have been integrated to improve the Nigerian Navy’ capacity to track and counter marine threats through its RMAC.” Handing over the consignment at the Nigerian Naval Station Beecroft, U.S. Consul General Claire Pierangelo, highlighted the US Government’s continued support of Nigeria’s maritime security. Pierangelo said, “The United States is committed to supporting the Nigerian Navy in its efforts towards securing not only your territorial waters but the larger Gulf of Guinea. The equipment we have here today is part of the RMAC that began in 2006, aimed at enhancing the Nigerian Navy’s capacity to monitor and respond to the diverse maritime threats in your waters and the Gulf of Guinea. “We previously transferred two ex-U.S. Coast Guard Cutters to the Nigerian Navy, now known as NNS OKPABANA and NNS THUNDER, which are proving to be key elements of your anti-piracy and maritime security efforts.” Rear Admiral Tanko Pani, Chief Staff Officer, Western Naval Command, Lagos, who received the surveillance equipment on behalf of the Nigerian Navy, commented on the long-standing security cooperation between the United States and Nigeria. He noted that the equipment would have an impact on the Navy’s maritime defence capabilities.
