An angry mob has burnt to death three suspected thieves in the Aseese area of Mowe in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. It was learnt that the suspects were beaten to death, and their vehicle was set ablaze on suspicion of theft.  At the scene of the incident, the police from the Mowe Division saved two other persons from being murdered. While reacting to this incident, the Ogun State Police Command's Spokesman, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, expressed concerns at the rate members of the public take laws into their own hands. The command also noted the okada riders' group is guilty of this barbaric act. The group has been accused of attacking motorists involved in an accident with any of their members and also setting such vehicles ablaze regardless of whether their member is at fault or not. The police warned that unlawful behaviour would no longer be tolerated in any part of the state, adding that anybody caught in such a dastardly act would be decisively dealt with in accordance with the dictate of the law. "In as much as every member of the public has the power to arrest anyone who is suspected of having committed a crime, the provision of the law is that such arrested person should be handed over to any of the law enforcement agencies for proper investigation and prosecution. "It is, therefore, an act of barbarism for anybody to apply jungle justice on anyone no matter how weighty the allegation "Human life is sacred, and it is sacrilegious for anybody to unlawfully take another person's life. "Those who are fond of this primitive act are hereby warned to desist from it henceforth, as the command will not leave any stone unturned to prosecute offenders and bring such person to justice," Oyeyemi said.
