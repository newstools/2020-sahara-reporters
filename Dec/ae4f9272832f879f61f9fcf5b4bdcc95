The Senate on Wednesday asked the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Arbovirus and the Vector Research Centre to investigate the source of a strange illness, which has claimed lives in Benue State. The senators made this resolution following a motion on the urgent need to deal with the outbreak of the mysterious ailment suspected to be Yellow Fever, ravaging Epeilo-Otukpa and Itahono-Owukpa communities in Ogbadibo Local Government Area of Benue State. Benue State Map Senator Patrick Abba, representing Benue South in the red chamber, moved the motion. The Senate also appealed to the Federal Ministry of Health to urgently assemble focal persons to the affected areas to aid the efforts of the Benue State Government in discovering the nature of the ailment.
