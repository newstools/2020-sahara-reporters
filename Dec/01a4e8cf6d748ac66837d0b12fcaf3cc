Residents of Charanchi Local Government Area of Katsina State have killed and burnt three gunmen suspected to be bandits. According to Katsina Post, the suspected bandits were caught with an AK-47 rifle at the Charanchi market on Sunday. Google “The bandits came to the cattle section of the market to sell their cattle but a good Samaritan noticed one of them carrying a gun. “All of them were wearing gowns, apparently to conceal what they were carrying. “On seeing the rifle, the people of the market descended on them, killed two of them instantly and set them ablaze. “One of them was able to escape the mob attack with serious injuries but couldn’t leave the market. He was later found dead in a gutter and was also set ablaze,” a villager said. Katsina, the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari, has been plagued by bandits who regularly attack villagers and kidnap them for ransom.
