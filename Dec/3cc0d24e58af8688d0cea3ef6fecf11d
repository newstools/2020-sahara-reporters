The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, has blamed insecurity in the Niger Delta to the failure of the region’s governors to develop the oil-producing communities. According to Daily Trust, Enang stated this when members of the Domestic Refineries Owners Association of Nigeria (DROAN), paid him a courtesy call. Ita Enang The presidential aide, who is a patron of the group, said the region is suffering from the “wickedness of the governors who have caused insecurity by refusing to apply the 13% derivation to develop the oil-producing communities.” He alleged that the governors had made the region unlivable, unbearable and security unwise. “The governors of the Niger Delta have caused insecurity by refusing to apply the 13% derivation to develop the oil-producing communities. “The high cost of salaries and earnings of those who work in the petroleum industry, we pay it. We pay for the high cost of what the oil industry workers are paying to the Lagos State Government for living in Banana Island and Lekki. All these are as a result of insecurity.”
