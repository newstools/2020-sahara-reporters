We celebrate the transition to glory of our beloved Daddy, Rev. (Prof.) Jonathan Olujare Lawoyin. Rev. (Prof.) Jonathan Olujare Lawoyin lived his life in service to God and humanity, fulfilling his mandate in the dental practice as professor of oral pathology, as well as in ministry.  Professor J.O Lawoyin attended Dallas Baptist University in the United States of America, where he obtained a Bachelor's degree. He then went on to dental school at Howard University in Washington, where he became a Doctor of Dental Surgery, and Glasgow, where he obtained a masters’ degree. On his return to Nigeria in the late ’70s, Prof. J.O. Lawoyin committed himself to advance the field of oral pathology, primarily at the University of Ibadan and the University College Hospital for nearly four decades. At different times lecturer, head of the department, and dean of the faculty of dentistry, Prof. J.O. Lawoyin taught many generations of students who went on to excel in the field of dentistry across the world. Following his retirement in 2011, Prof. J.O. Lawoyin continued on contract at the University of Ibadan, where he helped to pioneer the forensic odontology postgraduate programme.Ordained in the Baptist tradition, Rev. J.O. Lawoyin served as the undershepherd of New Haven Baptist Church, Ibadan, from 1989 to 2016, first in the capacity of founding church leader, then as the church’s pastor. Beyond stipulated pastoral duties, his ministry extended to the local and global community. Daddy, you loved us well. You provided, and you counselled, you listened, and you cheered us on. Most importantly, you and mummy pointed us to Christ, and you held fast to Him till your last breath. We rejoice in hope and eagerly await the day we reunite in Christ. Until then, thank you for a life well-lived!
