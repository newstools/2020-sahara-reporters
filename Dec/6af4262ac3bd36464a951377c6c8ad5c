"The National Assembly that is supposed to represent the people should know by now that in the eyes of this President, they only exist on paper because they are mere toothless bulldogs. Gov. Ayodele Fayose "Some of those Rep members should expect an EFCC invitation, freezing of their accounts or arrest for plotting to bring down the legitimate government of the President. I warned."
