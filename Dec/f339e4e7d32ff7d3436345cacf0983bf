The two sections of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State, are presently blocked, particularly around the Magboro area as a result of a gas pipeline explosion by the Punch newspaper office. The Federal Road Safety Corps, in an advisory obtained by SaharaReporters, stated that due to the "standstill traffic situation on both sections of the expressway, motorists could take an alternative route."  The corps advised that people who do not have time-bound activities may explore alternative routes and postpone their trips.
