Troops of the Nigerian military attached to Operation Awatse have arrested 10 oil thieves who were vandalising government pipelines in Arepo – a transit area along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in Ogun State. The Defence Headquarters, Abuja, said on Thursday in a briefing in Abuja that after the vandals were apprehended, six fuel trucks, which they had loaded, were also recovered from them.  The DHQ Defence Media Operations Coordinator, Maj Gen John Enenche, stated these, adding that the military would continue to flush out oil thieves in the region. Enenche said, “In the South-West zone, troops of Operation Awatse have continued to intensify the fight against pipeline vandals, economic saboteurs and other criminal elements in the area. Within the period under review, troops of Operation Awatse while on routine patrol intercepted six trucks fully loaded with stolen petroleum products at Arepo. “The operation was conducted after troops carried out an intensified surveillance within the general area. Accordingly, troops moved swiftly to the area and met vandals loading their trucks with the fuel. Troops arrested 10 of the vandals and six trucks loaded with products.”
