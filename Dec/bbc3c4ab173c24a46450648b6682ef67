The NGF said this was mainly in the North-West and South-West regions.The NGF Chairman and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, had stated this, against the background of the recent massacre of at least 78 farmers in Zabarmari, Borno State, by the Boko Haram fighters. Fayemi noted that the insecurity in the country was not limited to Borno State or the North-East as there is a nexus between terrorists' activities in the North-East and the banditry in the North-West as well as the kidnapping in the southern part of the country.
