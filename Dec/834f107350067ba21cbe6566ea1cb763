The National Identity Management Commission, the body issuing national identity number, has announced 15 locations abroad to enrol Nigerians in the diaspora. NIMC said that the firms would obtain and transmit biometric data from the countries which they operate to the commission.  The commission had earlier stated that without a NIN, Nigerians in diaspora would be unable to renew their passports or take part in some other national programmes, adding that those who already had Nigerian numbers would lose them. The development had sparked outrage with many Nigerians warning that the policy lacked adequate planning and would worsen the second wave of COVID-19 in the country. The list of countries and their NIN registration centres as released by the NIMC are: 1. AUSTRIA Vienna Embassy/Permanent Mission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Rennweg 25, Postfach (P.O.
