Bandits who kidnapped seven residents of Dankurmi village in the Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State have refused to release their victims despite collecting N4 million as ransom. The gunmen had on October 29 stormed the village and murdered one Alhaji Haruna Koli, an elderly person, before kidnapping the victims.  Those kidnapped include Hajiya Baraka Sani, wife of the district head of Dankurmi, Alhaji Sani Usman, and her four children. The gunmen also went away with two men identified as Ibrahim Tailor and Lawali Dogo. A source told SaharaReporters that the bandits later contacted their families and demanded a sum of N50m for their release. He said the families were able to raise N4m which was sent to the gunmen, who have refused to release the victims. “All the families involved contributed N4 million and it was delivered to the bandits, but they have not released our people. “They even collected N20,000 recharge cards from us, the state government was informed but did nothing about it,” the source said.
