Gunmen suspected to be cult members have shot dead a man, Uche Emmanuel, who came to drink at a bar in the Igbe, Ikorodu area of Lagos State. SaharaReporters learnt that Emmanuel was shot twice on the stomach and the thigh while he was relaxing at the bar, Dots Spot at Olomitutu Junction at about 6.30 pm.  It was gathered that while the incident occurred last Friday and was reported at the Ikorodu division, the police have not yet arrested any of the attackers. According to a police report, the wife of the deceased reported the case the following day at the station. There was confusion at the bar as other customers and sympathisers tried to save Emmanuel's life and rushed him to the Ijede General Hospital in Ikorodu, but he did not make it. The police report said, "One Mary of Olomitutu area, Igbe, Ikorodu, came to the station and reported that her husband, Uche Emmanuel, was shot in the stomach and on thigh at about 6.30 pm. "The corpse has been deposited at the morgue of the Ikorodu General Hospital, while the Superintendent of Police in the area has ordered his team to leave no stone unturned in finding the killers. "He was shot by unknown persons at Dots Spot. She immediately rushed him to the Ijede General Hospital, where he gave up the ghost. And his corpse was deposited at Ikorodu General Hospital's mortuary."
