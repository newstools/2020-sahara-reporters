Some bandits have struck the Runka community in the Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State, killing one person and abducting newlyweds. The attackers struck in the early hours of Monday, December 28, according to Channels Television, making the state now a flashpoint for banditry.  Few weeks earlier, the bandits abducted over 300 Government Senior Secondary Schoolboys in Kankara, Katsina State, before waylaying some other Qu’ranic school pupils days later. The Katsina State Police Command Spokesperson, Gambo Isah, confirmed the incident, while disclosing that he was making efforts to contact the Divisional Police Officer in the local government for more details. A resident of Runka told Channels Television that the bandits killed one Sama’ila Super, an uncle of the lawmaker representing Safana Constituency in the Katsina State House of Assembly. They also abducted newlyweds, whose names had yet to be ascertained. Super was killed after he resisted attempts by the bandits to kidnap him and was reportedly buried hours after the incident.
