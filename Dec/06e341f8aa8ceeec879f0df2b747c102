National President of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Alhaji  Muhammadu Kirowa, has slammed the various states leaders of the group for the rise of insecurity in most parts of the country.According to Vanguard, Kirowa stated this at the inauguration ceremony of North-Western States executives of MACBAN held in Dutse. He said state Fulani leaders were responsible for the spate of insecurity in their domain as they allowed youths to go on rampage against other citizens.The President, who could not hide his anger at the occasion, explained that it is a common fact Fulani` are  victims of various forms of persecutions and criminality due to what he described as “dearth of own media by the Fulani to express their voices.”He said, “Before any other person gets kidnapped, about twenty or more Fulani people must have suffered the same fate with payment of ransoms, which no media had bothered to report or investigate in the past.“We have to tell ourselves the truth that we have failed in our responsibility of giving our children the right training and good upbringing that ought to have shaped them for better people.“We cannot continue to wallow in denial when it is a fact that majority of criminals arrested across the country are from within us, our kith and kin who have gone into this circle because if our sheer negligence.”Kirowa, who is also the Ardon Zuru, stated further that the ball is now on the court of leaders and the rest of the Fulani societies to either unite and provide their children with a better home training and education or continue to strain the name of the tribe to ineptness.
