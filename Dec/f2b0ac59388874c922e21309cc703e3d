Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, says although the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is a leader, he cannot be called the "leader" of the Yoruba race. The group also said it had not given its support for any Yoruba indigene eyeing the 2023 presidency. Yinka Odumakin
SaharaReporters Media A spokesperson for the group, Yinka Odumakin, said this during a live interview with Punch monitored by SaharaReporters on Wednesday. When asked if Tinubu can be regarded as the Yoruba race leader, Odumakin said, "He is a leader, but not the leader Of the Yoruba race. That is debatable." Odumakin said that due to the political considerations that the presidency should go to the South-East and South-West, Afenifere had not made up its mind on a specific candidate to support. He said Afenifere would not support any candidates just because they are Yoruba people. He said, "For me, there is still quite a lot of debate out there. Yes, Yoruba people are contesting the position. Some feel strongly it should go to Igbo because they have never held the position. "When the time comes, a decision would be taken. Afenifere won't automatically endorse Yoruba politicians. For us in Afenifere, we look at the matter objectively and what they (candidates) are offering. You will not earn our support for just being a Yoruba man. "We have not taken a stand for anybody; we are watching those interested, including Kayode Fayemi, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Pastor Tunde Bakare, and so many other people, even non-Yorubas. We are watching all of them. "We are looking at where each candidate stands on the core issue like restructuring. Nigeria is at the edge of failure. To bring Nigeria back from that edge, we need to restructure Nigeria back to federal status. The late Obafemi Awolowo held a strong position on this all his life."
