"Immediately the report of the incident got to the notice of the Divisional Police Officer Moniya, a search party comprising plain-clothes/tactical police teams, vigilantes, hunters, and Amotekun Corps swung into action and were deployed to far and near bushes to comb the areas for possible arrest of the hoodlums and also to get the kidnapped farmer released.
