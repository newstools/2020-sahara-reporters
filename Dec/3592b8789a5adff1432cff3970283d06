A former Kaduna State senator and social critic, Shehu Sani, has expressed disappointment with the overdependence of the country on arms importation to tackle insecurity, noting that it was time to develop the local defence industry. Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the Eight Assembly, said on Twitter on Wednesday that it was also wrong for the West or developed countries to deny Nigeria the weapons that would enable it to prosecute the war on terror. Shehu Sani He said, "It's wrong for the West to deny Nigeria the sale of weapons to prosecute its war on terror. It's inexcusable for Nigeria to fail, considering that other countries sell weapons. It's also foolish for Nigeria at 60 to abandon its local defence industry and rely on import." Itâs wrong for the West to deny Nigeria the sale of weapons to prosecute its war on terror.Its inexcusable for Nigeria to fail considering that there are other countries that sells weapons.Its also foolish for Nigeria at 60 to abandon its local defense industry & rely on import.  In responses to Sani, a commentator, @BillionMont said, "Exactly the strategy the All Progressives Congress used against GEJ in 2015. They got the West to prevent the administration from buying weapons. Now they are facing the same music. What goes around, comes around. Ordinary Nigerians suffer the brunt of it." Another Twitter user, @ganewhimself said, "Military formations all over the world have continued to innovate and influence their country's development, for example, the internet is an invention of the U.S. Military, and the same can be said of other countries. What has the Nigerian military produced?" Sani's comments butresses calls for change in Nigeria as the security situation worsens. Nigerians have continued to react to the massacre of  Borno State farmers last Saturday – an occurrence where sources said over 80 persons were tied and slaughtered. An infuriated Senate on Tuesday had called on the President to sack the service chiefs who seemed to be lacking ideas to ensure national security. The House of Representatives had also summoned the President to appear before it and answer to the killings. The Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, who seemed to have lost faith in the Nigerian armed forces, had stated on Monday that the President should engage the services of mercenaries to clear the entire Sambisa Forest. The governor had said, "One of our recommendations as possible solutions to end the insurgency is the immediate recruitment of our youths into military and paramilitary services to complement the efforts of the Nigerian forces. "Our third recommendation is for the President to engage the services of mercenaries to clear the entire Sambisa forest." In three minutes and 37-second video, a masked Boko Haram leader had come out to say on Tuesday that the insurgents carried out the massacre because the farmers arrested one of its members and handed him over to the Nigerian military.
