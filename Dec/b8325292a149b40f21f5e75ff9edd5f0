14 Hours Ago At today's sitting, Arabo, an investigator with the EFCC, told the court that Nwoko ignored the EFCC's invitation when he was invited to corroborate the claims of the defendant that the sum of N65million paid into his account was payment for lawyers, who handled the election tribunal matter in court. According to a statement from the EFCC, when asked by the defence counsel, O.E.B Offiong(SAN), if he could not have called any of the lawyers who received the money from the Attorney General on account of the defendant, Arabo said: "The Attorney-General was the only one we could call because the money went into his account and it was natural to invite him as the sole signatory to the account." Arabo, during cross-examination, further told the court that though the EFCC had written letters to the Secretary to the State Government of Akwa-Ibom state requesting the release of certain officials, the Attorney-General was, at that time, not included because the need had not arisen. He added, "However when he was needed, he failed to show up." Justice Aikawa adjourned the case to January 20 and 21, 2021 for the continuation of trial.
