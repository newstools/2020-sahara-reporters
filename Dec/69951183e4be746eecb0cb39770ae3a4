avalondaily This is the first election that would be taking place in Lagos since the #EndSARS protest. The development has led to mixed reactions on Twitter as Nigerians debated the low turnout. Most youths explained that their reason for not voting was because the Peoples Democratic Party as well as the All Progressives Congress – the two major parties – are birds of the same feather.  Both APC and PDP are same set of people changing colour of agbada, we have both their records of failure, and SORO SOKE generation will not partake in electing further failure. We want total haulage come 2023.  Senator Jaywon @juuwoncares gave the excuse of location as his inability to vote. He asked, "How can I vote when I need to travel to my polling unit to cast my vote?"

He tweeted, "Because their party isn't ready yet! APC, PDP are the same, and we have lost hope in them."

APC OR PDP is not the problem but the youth non involvement to take over what belongs to them." So the way for the soro soke to take over is by protest or burning right? Youth needs to be directly involved in politics. APC OR PDP is not the problem but the youth non involvement to take over what belongs to them.  Another in this school of thought, Rt. Hon. Olanrewaju Solomon,  tweeted, "They can never be at their polling units but on the Internet casting their vote... it's a pity for SORO SOKE GENERATION sha... The government will create an opportunity for them, they will not make use of it, but in the end, they will be complaining of bad government... No sense."

The PDP candidate in Lagos-East, Babatunde Gbadamosi, complained about the low voter turnout, blaming it on the failure of the Independent National Electoral Commission to educate voters properly.
