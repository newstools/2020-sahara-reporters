Ivory Coast President, Alassane Ouattara, has taken the oath of office for a third presidential term. At the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Ouattara whose victory at the October 31 election continues to ignite controversies, urged the opposition to help defuse tensions ahead of next year's general elections.  According to a report by the AFP, the ceremony was attended by 13 African counterparts as well as former French president Nicolas Sarkozy but boycotted by the opposition. Speaking at the event, the 78-year-old president said, "I ask all political parties to seize this new opportunity to defuse tensions through dialogue." The opposition had accused Ouattara of breaching the constitution by seeking a third term and had mounted a campaign of "civil disobedience" aimed at pushing him out. But the development had resulted in the arrest of several opposition leaders who were charged with sedition. Pre- and post-election violence has claimed at least 85 lives in the country since August, according to an official toll. The situation in the country has reawakened the painful memories that characterised the aftermath of the 2010 elections, which left many divided.
