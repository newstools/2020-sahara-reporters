According to Vanguard, Adebisi was arraigned by DSS on four counts bordering on forgery, impersonation and illegal possession of Nigerian Army Uniform, and had since December 14, 2020, been remanded in Ilesha Custodial Centre. #EndSARS Protesters The presiding magistrate, Mr Isola Omisade, had declined oral bail application of the defendant, ordering his counsel to apply for his bail formally. However, when the matter was called for hearing on December 21, 2020, counsel from the Ministry of Justice, Barrister Oyedele Akintayo, applied to formally take over the matter from the DSS, a request which was granted by the magistrate.
