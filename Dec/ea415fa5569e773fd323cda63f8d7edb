The Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has called on the people of the region to ignore the so-called security outfit set up by the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Umahi, who described the outfit as laughable, stressed that the governors of the region had been doing their best to ensure the protection of lives and property of citizens within the South-East zone.  The governor stated this while briefing reporters on the recent development across the country, Vanguard reports. He warned youths to avoid being used as instruments of destruction even as he emphasized that the southeast governors would never allow the ugly incident that occurred during the #EndSARS protests to repeat itself. He said, “Our region remains the safest, and nobody can deny this. And so, our brother said he had formed a security outfit for the southeast. It is very laughable and should be ignored. I commend the southeast governors very highly. It is only the southeast that the leaders are being criticized openly. “The governors must protect the lives of the citizens and also the citizens of other regions living in their states that are not from the southeast. “I want them to ignore the side distractions. They are doing a lot in the education of our people, payment of salaries, infrastructure development, and most especially the security of our people. “No governor will come open to tell you A to Z of what he is doing about security. But I want it to be debated whether the southeast is not the safest in the country. We need to warn that our youths should desist from being engaged for the destruction of lives and property.” He added, “Whether we like it or not, we are confronting global challenges, and Nigeria is not an exception. So, we thank God for the courage, ability and the health God gave our president to steer the ship of our nation in a very challenging time like this."
