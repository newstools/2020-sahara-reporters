The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Akwa Ibom State, has arraigned Professor Ignatius Uduk in court for allegedly declaring false election results. Prof. Uduk was said to have declared and published false election results during the 2019 State House of Assembly election when he served as collation/returning officer at INEC office, Afaha Ikot Ebak in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.  The professor was arraigned on three count charges of abandonment of duties and generation of false scores on form EC BE (II) on March 10, 2019, at INEC office in Afaha Ikot Ebak during the State House of Assembly elections; announcement and publication of false election result; and lying on oath at the inception of the election petition tribunal. He pleaded not guilty to the three count charges levelled against him, while his counsel, Samuel Ndah, prayed that the professor be granted bail. Counsel to INEC, Kpoobari Sigalo, who had filed a counter-affidavit, however, objected that the defendant be granted bail as he had proved to be evasive. The presiding judge, Justice Archibong Archibong, adjourned the case to December 14, 2020, for ruling on the bail application, DT reports.
