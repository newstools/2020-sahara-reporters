Nigerians in Dublin, Ireland, are currently mourning a 27-year-old Nigerian, George Nkencho, who was shot dead by the Irish police, Gardai, on Wednesday. Earlier, hundreds of aggrieved blacks held a protest at Blanchardstown Garda station, calling for justice over the police killing of Nkencho, an incident which occurred in the Manorfields Drive area, near the Dublin/Meath border.  The protesters, mostly blacks and believed to be Africans, were seen screaming, “Justice for George” as the policemen tried in vain to pacify the crowds. Some Nigerians, who spoke with SaharaReporters, argued that contrary to police’s wild claims, Nkencho was neither a thug nor a criminal, but he had some mental challenges. A source said, “You know when something like this happens, the authorities involved can say anything to defend themselves. Remember they said something like that about George Floyd. He's not mad. “We, the black community, are trying to see how the incident can get global media attention.” See Also

7 Hours Ago Another Nigerian, who asked not to be named, said, "15 armed Garda surrounded him. Something like this has happened in the past, and the Gardai were able to handle it. "There was an incident this year where a white man who threatened the Gardai with a knife wasn't killed. Instead, he was given a €25 fine. "Another one happened in 2014  when a 19-year-old white, who went into the Dail (Parliament) with knives and a sword, was apprehended by only two Gardai. What happened to George yesterday (with 15 armed Gadai around him), was unacceptable. We believe there are other ways they could handle the situation without killing him." According to the police, Nkencho was allegedly involved in two separate incidents in the Hartstown Shopping Centre around 12.15pm.
