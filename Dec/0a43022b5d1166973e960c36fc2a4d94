Operatives of the recently inaugurated Eastern Security Network have been spotted carrying guns while on patrol, a viral video showed on Wednesday. The leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, launched ESN last week Saturday as a security outfit "to protect the South-East and South-South regions of the country from criminal activities."  According to the video which has gone viral, a voice in the background showed that the ESN members were from the Anambra command.

SaharaReporters had earlier reported that the Afenifere backed the creation of the ESN, when the National Public Secretary, Yinka Odumakin, said the federal police could not handle the security challenges in the country.
