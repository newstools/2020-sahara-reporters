Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho, has given reasons why the court froze the bank accounts of #EndSARS protesters. He disclosed this during a special court session the High Court held to mark the commencement of its 2020/2021 legal year.  A Federal High Court in Abuja had frozen bank accounts belonging to individuals who promoted the #EndSARS protests. According to Vanguard, the chief judge said the names attached to the bank accounts were not those of individuals but of corporate organisations the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) accused of sabotaging the country’s economy. He said, “Three months before the protest, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) kept bringing applications, almost in their hundreds, based on what they call deliberate resolve to ruin the economy through money laundering,” he said.
