A police sergeant has been arrested for allegedly stabbing his colleague, an Inspector to death and for injuring another victim while under the influence of alcohol over the weekend, SaharaReporters has gathered. The yet-to-be-named sergeant is currently being detained at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Yaba, after the Inspector, identified as Francis Adekunle, died in an undisclosed hospital. This is coming barely two weeks after a trigger-happy policeman killed some of his colleagues in Ikoyi, Lagos. It was gathered that the sergeant went berserk after drinking alcohol at a nearby liquor store and returned to his compound in Oke-Odo. He reportedly picked a quarrel with one of his neighbours, and was chasing the man about with a cutlass when the Inspector, said to be attached to the Special Protection Unit (SPU) 2 Ikeja, intervened. The sergeant pounced on the Inspector with the machete, leaving several cuts on his legs and body. The victim was rushed to the hospital where he died Monday morning.  Police spokesman Bala Elkana confirmed the arrest of the Sergeant, adding that the police commissioner in the state had ordered an investigation into the incident. “They both stay in town with other civilians. They were neither on duty nor anywhere near a police facility when it happened. I have to correct that impression because a lot of people have been calling me to say it happened inside the barrack. “No matter where it happened, a crime was committed and the suspect is in custody. I will issue a statement soon on this incident,” he said.
