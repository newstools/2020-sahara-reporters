Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Monday met with President Muhammadu Buhari at Aso Villa in Abuja. Obaseki's visit is coming ahead of the APC governorship primary election in the state. He is reportedly seeking Buhari's intervention in the conflict between him and the party's National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. The National Working Committee of the party headed by Oshiomhole had settled for direct primary in the state even though Obaseki and his loyalists are seeking indirect primary. See Also
