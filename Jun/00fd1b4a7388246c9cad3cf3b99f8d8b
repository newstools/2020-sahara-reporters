Seun Fakorede, Oyo State Commissioner for Youth And Sports, has tested positive for Coronavirus. Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, had earlier contracted the disease, sparking fears among his loyalist. On Thursday, Abiola Ajimobi, immediate-past governor of the state, died of Coronavirus. Ajimobi had been on life support machine for close to a week before his death. Confirming his status, Fakorede in a Facebook post said, "I tested positive for COVID-19 and want you to know that there's no cause for any panic as I'm very well, safe and sound without any symptoms/breakdown. "Before the test result came in, I had no inkling that I was going to test positive. This was because, despite the demands of the office I occupy, I have been careful since COVID-19 crept into our world — I took the test just like others and didn’t nurse any fear. I was asymptomatic, I still am, and I remain fearless. "I have immediately followed and adhered strictly to the directives of the Incident Management for the Oyo State Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic.
