Chief (Capt) Samuel Owonaro was a great man, a wonderful liberation partner to the late Major Isaac Jasper Adaka Boro, a great soul of matchless courage, one of the great men in history. Great orators, great soldiers, great lawyers often use their gifts for the most unholy cause. We meet in this space, a virtual one at that, to pay tribute of love and respect to Chief (Capt) Owonaro because he used his matchless power for the good of mankind. He was a Chief of Staff of the Niger Delta Volunteer Force in 1966. He was arrested and tried by the Nigerian Government and sentenced to death.He was in prison waiting execution for a few months until a counter coup brought General Yakubu Gowon (retd) to power and released him from jail. Between 1967-1970 Samuel Owonaru was a Captain in the Nigerian Army. He fought on the side of the Federal Government against the separatists for the Biafra State. He sustained a serious injury during the Civil War and was left wheelchair-bound. Great hero, you have fought a good fight and carved your name on hearts, not tombstones. A legacy is etched into the minds of others and the stories they share about you. On whose palm the baton you have handed over lies knows himself. Sleep on great one!
