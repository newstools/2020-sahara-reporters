The Daily Show host, Trevor Noah, has reacted to unarmed African American George Floyd’s death which has sparked outrage. In a video posted on The Daily Show YouTube account, Noah recounted a series of events which he believed may have led to the current unrest, including the case of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed 25-year-old African-American man who was fatally shot by a White man while jogging in Georgia back in February.  Just last week, a viral video showed Amy Cooper, a White woman who called the cops on a black man, lying that he was harassing her after he cautioned her to put a leash on her dog, per the park’s protocol. Cooper has since apologized and was fired from her job. "Amy Cooper was for many people, I think, the catalyst," he said. "Here you have this woman who — we've all seen the video now — blatantly knew how to use the power of her whiteness to threaten the life of another man and his blackness. What we saw with her was a powerful explicit example of an understanding of racism in a structural way." Noah also talked about the effects of COVID-19 on people, especially them losing their jobs, and being stuck at home for a long period, with no genuine plan from leadership on what’s going to happen. Noah believes that Floyd’s murder triggered emotions of black people who for so long, have had to endure racial injustices, stressing that while everyone else is facing coronavirus, black people have to face the pandemic and racism. “Blacks watch time and time again and see that their part of the contract is not being honoured by a society that forced them to sign it,” he said. “We need people at the top to be the most accountable because they are the ones who are setting the tone for everything that we do in society.” As for the people condemning the riots, Noah believes it should be a two-way street. “There is no contract if the law and people in power don't uphold their end of it,” he said.
