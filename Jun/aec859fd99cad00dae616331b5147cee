Gunmen on Tuesday night kidnapped a female student of the University of Jos. The sister of the student identified as Helen, told PUNCH that the 300-level Zoology undergraduate will not be released until ransom was paid. She said, “We were in our house around 8:30pm when a voice from outside asked us to open the door. Five of us were in the house including my mother and my sister (Helen). “My mother demanded to know who was at the door but the voice insisted that we must open the door. They started shooting and before we knew it, they entered our house after using a heavy stone to forcefully open the door. “They collected our cell phones and threatened to kill all of us if we make any move. “They asked my mother who my sister is to her and she (mother) said she is her daughter. The gunmen then said they would go with her. They also left a message that they won’t release Helen until a ransom was paid.” Sources at the police command headquarters in Jos said security agencies had visited the staff quarters where Helen and her family stays and had commenced an investigation into the kidnapping.
