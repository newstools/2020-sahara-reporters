Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has continued to insist that the state was COVID-19-free despite the recent death of the state's Chief Judge, Justice Nasiru Ajanah, at an isolation facility. Governor Bello said the late Chief Judge died a natural death, urging the people to discard any news of Coronavirus in the state. Speaking on Tuesday during the three-day fidau prayer for the late Chief Judge, Bello said Ajanah had been battling illness before COVID-19 came into the country. The governor described the deceased as an "outstanding jurist, who left a memorable imprint on the legal profession in the country and a lover of peace". He said, “Nothing kills faster like fear, people should not accept cut and paste. COVID-19 is only out to create fear, panic, pandemic. "It is a disease orchestrated to reduce and shorten the lifespan of the people.
