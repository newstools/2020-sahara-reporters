SaharaReporters has uncovered how Managing Director of Nigeria Incentive-based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending, Aliyu Abdulhameed, has siphoned close to N1bn using the private bank account of the agency's Head of Finance, Idris Issa Aweda, as a conduit. Aweda uses three personal bank accounts: FCMB (4986133010), GTB (0245155058), and Stanbic IBTC (0021195810) to receive proceeds of fraud on behalf of Abdulhameed. Although NIRSAL is not a security agency, Abdulhameed fraudulently orders payment of money for “advance for security challenge in the North-East on the farms fields”, “security challenge in the North-Central on the farms fields”, “advance for external security issue armoured car” and “advance for security challenge in the South-East on the farms fields”. 

Aliyu Abdulhameed These illegal funds are directly wired into the private bank accounts of Aweda. For instance, at 4:50pm on August 16, 2017, NIRSAL paid N8m into the GTB account number 0245155058 of Aweda being payment for "security". Also, on October 6, 2017, at 4:56pm, NIRSAL credited Aweda's GTB account with the sum of N8m for "security imprest". As at October 2019, Aweda still received money in his personal account. At 9:31am on October 23, 2019, over N12m was paid into Aweda's FCMB account 4986133027. When SaharaReporters contacted NIRSAL's Head of Corporate Communications, Anne Ihugba, she said, “I don't know if this is SaharaReporters. I was also a journalist. Send me a mail.” She afterwards sent a text message, which reads "please send your enquiries to a.ihugba@nirsal.com and I will adequately respond to you. Thank you". SaharaReporters discovered that Abdulhameed uses Aweda's personal bank accounts to perpetuate financial fraud so as to eliminated anyone tracing the stolen funds to him.
