Nigerians have called for the arrest of musician, Azeez Fashola popularly known as Naira Marley, for holding a concert in Abuja despite the ban on gatherings and events of more than 20 people in the country put in place by government to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the country. Many Nigerians have been arrested and charged to court for flouting the order including Nollywood star, Funke Akindele and her husband, Abdul Bello for hosting a house party. Naira Marley had on Saturday uploaded a video of him and his crew alighting from a chartered plane. The concert by Marley had led to public criticism with many calling for his arrest.

Lucipost Calling for the arrest of the musician, @utuakpa said “@NCDCgov @PoliceNG PIease arrest Naira Marley and the organizers of that Jabi concert.” @NCDCgov @PoliceNG PIease arrest Naira Marley and the organizers of that Jabi concert.   Dear @PoliceNG, Arrest Naira Marley and the organizers of the Jabi Lake concert now. This insensitivity cannot be overlooked.   Injustice: We did it against Funke Akindele, we must do it against Naira Marley also even if you are a Marlian.Else you are worse than Buhari.   They need to arrest Naira Marley. So fucking irresponsible. Everyone who went to that concert, idiots.   When Funke Akindele hosted a house party...The Lagos State police rushed to arrest her courtesy LASGNow Naira Marley had a concert in Abuja but the IGP is no where to be found.FG has gone deaf...later @NCDCgovwill send me a useless message....keep pushing us to the wall!!! pic.twitter.com/ZVwphOyRiA   FAAN needs to explain how a aircraft left Lagos to Abuja with Naira Marley aboard in the midst of this pandemic. I call on @PoliceNG to arrest the idiot called Naira Marley and those associated with the concert. If you also attended the concert, you're also an idiot. No apologies   1. Somebody approved the Naira Marley concert2. Somebody approved the non-essential flight to Abuja3. Somebody approved a bottle of hard liquor per ticket4. Somebody didnât stop the concert when it lost control6. Somebody should be sacked this morning...if somebody is serious   Pls @hadisirika investigate the domestic flight that brought Naira Marley to Abuja. Was the flight for humanitarian / pharmaceutical issues @FAAN_Official . We need explanation .
