The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has advised the leadership of political parties wishing to adopt the direct primary mode to elect their candidates for the Edo and Ondo states governorship polls to submit their membership register to the commission. Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC Chairman, who announced during a virtual meeting with the leaders of a political party, said the membership register would allow the commission to effectively monitor the party primaries in the two states.  Yakubu added that the political parties should furnish the commission with the list of its delegates if opting for the indirect primary mode. He charged the parties to ensure rancour-free primaries, adding that party primaries form the foundation for the secondary election conducted by the commission. He said, "The commission makes available to each political party the complete register of voters before every major election. We expect political parties to reciprocate for their primaries. "Today, it is exactly 110 days to the Edo governorship election scheduled for 19th September 2020 and 131 days to the Ondo Governorship election holding on 10th October 2020. "Already, some political parties have invited the commission to monitor their primaries which must be conducted from 2nd to 27th June 2020. This time, the submission of nomination forms will be done online for which a dedicated portal has been set up. “Let me, therefore, warn political parties that intend to field candidates for the election to strictly adhere to these dates as well as the new online procedure for filing of nominations.” He noted that the commission had also released the policy for conducting the elections during the COVID-19 pandemic. Already, both the APC and the PDP in the two states have announced dates for their primaries in June and July 2020.
