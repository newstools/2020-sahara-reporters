Some officials of the Ebonyi State Government have tested positive for COVID-19. Commissioner for Information and Orientation in the state, Orji Uchenna Orji, made this known in a statement on Thursday. The statement reads, “The governor is concerned about the number of Coronavirus cases recorded in the state which has unfortunately risen to 75 out of over 3,000 samples tested. 

Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi "Whereas we have discharged a total of 26 COVID-19 cases and 49 cases still receiving treatment and in stable conditions, the governor is disturbed about the way and manner some State Executive Council members were infected, although they are also in stable conditions. "In order to ensure effective contact tracing, he has directed that all government offices be shut down from Thursday, 4th June 2020, and resume on Wednesday, 10th June 2020. "In view of this development, he passionately appeals to all sons and daughters of Ebonyi State who are living outside the shores of the state to avoid the risk of returning to the state, as records have shown that the positive cases hitherto recorded in the state were those who returned from the epicentre states. "The governor further pleads with our people to take seriously the NCDC COVID-19 protocols, especially all precautionary measures such as hand washing, use of hand sanitizers, use of face masks, social distancing and avoiding of crowded places, more so as we have entered into another phase of spread of COVID-19 called community transmission. "All civil servants shall work from their respective homes within this period but shall leave their phones open to respond to official imperatives.”
