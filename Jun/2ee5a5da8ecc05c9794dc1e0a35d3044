Rights group, the Talakawas Parliament, has protested the rape and murder of Uwaila Vera Omozuwa, a 100-level student of the Univeristy of Benin, inside a church while reading. The group during a march to the Nigerian Union of Journalist office in Edo State on Wednesday also protested the murder of Nigerian lawyer, Omon Osobase Iyioha, who was allegedly kidnapped and killed by one Osasu Osadolo Afro and his gang over an argument. Speaking during the protest, a member of the group, Marxist Kola Edokpayi Pooh, called on the police to bring the culprits to book over the crimes in order to serve as a deterrent to others. He also condemned the Edo State Government for failing in their constitutional responsibility of providing security for the people, asking that justice be served swiftly in both matters.
