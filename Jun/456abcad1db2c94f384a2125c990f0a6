The older sibling opened the back door for him to do that. “Had I known, I would have asked him to do that in front of the house. Suddenly, he cried out, “Mummy, Mummy”. His older sibling and I rushed out to the backyard but we didn’t see him initially. “Then I checked beside the bush and found him macheted. He hadn’t died when we got there.
