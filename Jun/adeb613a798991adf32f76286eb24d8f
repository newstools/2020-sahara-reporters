A 20-year-old commercial motorcycle rider in Adamawa State has been shot dead by the police for refusing to give N100 bribe. The victim, Arabo Dauda, was said to have been killed at a police checkpoint in Maiha town under Maiha Local Government Area of the state. Chairman of Maiha the council area, Idi Amin, confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters on Tuesday. He said, "I got a distress call yesterday that a policeman had shot dead a 20-year-old young man at a checkpoint in Maiha. "Upon inquiry, I learnt it was because the youth did not give N100 at the checkpoint. "The boy was said to have been shot from behind while returning home from where he bought petrol. "I was further informed that the police had made it mandatory for all commuters along that road to pay N100 before they are allowed access. "I have informed the Commissioner of Police, Brigade Commander and the state governor of the incident." SaharaReporters gathered that the killing sparked protest in the town as angry youths almost torched a police station in the area. At the moment, the killer policeman is in detention at Zone 3 headquarters of the police in Yola, the state capital.
