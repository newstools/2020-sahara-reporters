Senator Aisha Binani representing Adamawa Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly has told Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, and wife of Nigeria’s President, Aisha Buhari, that she controls the All Progressives Congress in the state. Binani, the only female senator from Nigeria's Northern region, also told other party stalwarts in Adamawa that she was leader of the APC in the state. The lawmaker’s position followed accusations that she was undermining Mustapha, Mrs Buhari, former governor, Jibrilla Bindo, Nuhu Ribadu, and other top party members in a bid to control the APC in the state. Speaking on her behalf, one of Binani’s aides, Mauludu Usman Ibrahim, said, "She is second to none in the hierarchy of our party given her current status as the only APC senator in the state. "Therefore, to attempt to subjugate her to someone else is simply laughable; meaning she is naturally the leader of the party." Reacting on the issue, Mohammed Bappare, speaking on behalf of the Mustapha/Bindo group said, "Binani wants to be governor in 2023, that is why she is fuelling the leadership crisis."
