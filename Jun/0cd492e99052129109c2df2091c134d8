The Presidency on Sunday described the Northern Elders Forum, NEF, as a mere irritant and featherweight group without credible membership. The Presidency in a statement issued by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, likened NEF to a General without troops. President Muhammadu Buhari The Northern Elders Forum had earlier in a statement signed by its Convener,  Prof. Ango Abdullahi, alleged that the insecurity in some northern states of the country was an indication that President Muhammadu Buhari and the governors of those states had lost control over the protection of the people which is a constitutional duty. Reacting to the statement, the Presidency said, “We are not surprised by this latest statement by Prof. Abdullahi, and our past position on what his group represents remains unchanged: a mere irritant and featherweight. “The former vice-chancellor signed the statement under the banner of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF). Hearing that title, you would think the body was a conglomeration of true elders.

They don’t need a paper tiger to tell them anything.”
