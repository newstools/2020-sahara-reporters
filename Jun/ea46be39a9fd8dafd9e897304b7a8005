The Nigerian Government has ordered the police to unravel the circumstances surrounding the rape and murder of a female student of the University of Benin, Vera Uwaila Omozuwa. The directive is coming four days after the tragic incident, which had caused national outrage. In a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, though his media aide, Segun Adeyemi, asked the security agents to arrest and bring perpetrators of the heinous crime to justice. The minister described the incident as a cruel and barbaric act that offends human sensibility, in addition to being antithetical to decency, saying no society will tolerate such depravity. The statement also condemned the alleged gang rape of a 12-year-old girl by 14 men in Jigawa State, describing it as not only repulsive but highly condemnable. The statement reads, “The Federal Government has directed the police to unravel the circumstances surrounding the rape and murder of a female student of the University of Benin, Vera Uwaila Omozuwa, in Benin and the serial sexual abuse of a minor in Jigawa State by 14 men with a view to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
