Women Arise for Change Initiatives and Kudirat Initiative for Democracy have described Alhaja Kudirat Abiola, wife of the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, as mother of the struggle for democracy in Nigeria. The late Kudirat was hailed for displaying uncommon courage, virtue and doggedness during her lifetime. Presidents of Women Arise, Joe Okey Odumakin, and KIND, Hafsat Abiola-Costello, in a joint statement on said Kudirat’s gruesome murder was still fresh in their memories 24-year after. The statement reads, “We remember with fond memories the slain heroine and mother of the struggle for democracy in Nigeria, the indefatigable Alhaja Kudirat Abiola, who was gruesomely hacked down 24 years ago. “She roared like a lion at many pro-democracy gatherings and marches against the vile dictators and their cohorts trembled with trepidation. “For her stubborn and uncompromising defence of principles, the military authorities killed her on the streets of Lagos on June 4, 1996. “As we remember Kudirat today despite the Coronavirus pandemic that has made impossible physical gathering like we used to do in her honour, we must remain steadfast on the principles she died for. “We demand an end to wanton killings in the land, we also ask for freedom for Leah Sharibu and all others in the gulag of terrorists.”
