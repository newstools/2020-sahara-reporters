The Peoples Democratic Party has granted Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, and his deputy, Philip Shaibu, a waiver to fly the party’s flag in the September 19 governorship election in the state. SaharaReporters gathered that leaders of the party have pleaded with other aspirants vying to get the party' ticket to step down for the governor. Obaseki was disqualified by his former party, All Progressives Congress, from seeking re-election on the grounds that he possesses “defective academic qualifications.” He later announced his resignation from the APC and joined the PDP on Friday.
