Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, on Sunday accused his deputy, Mr Agboola Ajayi, and his aides of trying to move out government properties from the Government House following his planned defection to the Peoples Democratic Party. Akeredolu, who spoke through his media aides, said he wondered why Ajayi was moving out properties at night. Akeredolu's aide on New Media, Richard Olatunde, alleged that Ajayi's aides were caught on Saturday night with some furniture and a television set belonging to the state government. "They were made to return these items by the security men at the gate and instead they called the deputy governor, who later came with aides. "The governor is not stopping anyone from moving personal effects out of the government house but why must it be at night? Why not do it in broad daylight."  In another statement, Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Segun Ajiboye, denied that Akeredolu stopped his deputy and convoy from leaving the Government House. He said, "It should be placed on record that it is a time-tested code in governmentâ€™s business for officials to take inventory of offices and quarters before and after an official is moving in or out of offices or quarters. "But he (Ajayi) has a duty to be firm and dispassionate in exercising the roles assigned to him."  See Also
