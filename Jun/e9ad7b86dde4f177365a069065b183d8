According to him, the suspect had asked the younger sister of the deceased to hand over all the original documents of her brother to him which he intends to use in claiming his benefits. “The family member, having suspected a fraudulent intent, contacted the Acting Commander of NAF 209 Quick Response Group, Ipetu Ijesha, Osun State, ultimately leading to the arrest,” he said. Morphy said the suspect had been handed over to the police for further investigation and prosecution, stressing that NAF would not condone any act that can tarnish its image.
