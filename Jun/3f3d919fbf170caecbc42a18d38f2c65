Two grave diggers, who were caught severing the heads of some corpses at a cemetery last month in Ondo State, have been arraigned before a magistrate court in Akure, the state capital. Adewale Abiodun, 40, and Abel Olomofe, 45, were dragged before the court by the police following their arrest by residents of the community. They committed the offence on May, 23 2020 at about 3:00pm in the Imafon area of Akure South Local Government Area of the state where the cemetery is located. Their offence was said to be contrary to and punishable under sections 516, 329(a) and 242(b) of the Criminal Code Cap 37 Volume 1 Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006. Uloh Goodluck, police prosecutor in the case, said the duo had indecently tampered with corpses at the cemetery by severing their heads without lawful justification. He informed the court of his intention to call four prosecution witnesses and asked for an adjournment to enable him study the case file. Lawyer representing the two accused, Jide Agboola and Femi Adetoye, did not oppose the adjournment date sought by the police prosecutor over the case. However, they prayed the court to grant the two accused persons bail in most liberal terms pending proper prosecution. The lawyers also assured that the accused would not jump bail and would be available to face trial at the court. Magistrate Tope Aladejana however, declined granting bail to the accused persons and ordered their remand in police custody until June 8 for further hearing into the matter.
