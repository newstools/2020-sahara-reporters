President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the review and implementation of the White Paper on rationalisation of parastatals and agencies to cut the cost of governance. Buhari, who made the revelation in his speech on Friday, said the move was to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. He said, "The public service of Nigeria remains the bedrock for the formulation and implementation of policies, programmes and projects in the country. This accounts for why it continues to evolve especially as new socio-economic challenges emerge for the government to address. 

President Muhammadu Buhari "I will continue to give all the necessary support for the on-going reforms designed to return discipline, integrity and patriotism as the hallmark of the public service. "In the face of dwindling resources and rising cost of governance, I have authorized that the White Paper on the rationalisation of government parastatals and agencies be reviewed for implementation." Recall that a presidential committee on reform of government agencies constituted by former President Goodluck Jonathan and headed by former head of service, Steve Oronsaye, recommended the reduction of statutory agencies of government from 263 to 161. The report said, “There are 541 government parastatals, commissions and agencies (statutory and non-statutory) in the country. “Going by the recommendations of the committee, the figure of statutory agencies is being proposed for reduction to 161 from the current figure of 263. “The committee believes that if the cost of governance must be brought down, then both the legislature and judiciary must make spirited efforts at reducing their running costs as well as restructuring and rationalising the agencies under them since the three arms make up the government.”
