Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Monday said that the crisis in the state was caused by National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole. Obaseki said this while speaking with journalists in Abuja shortly after his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa. The visit is coming ahead of the All Progressives Congress governorship primary in the state. Obaseki said, “Well, I believe having been governor of the state for three years and the jury’s out, you can check with Edo people whether as governor I have served credibly. “The general consensus is that we have done well as a government and that people would like us to continue with the laudable programs and policies which we have been taking over in the last three years.

22 Hours Ago “The problem in Edo is not from within Edo, it is from outside. So I don’t see the person I am competing or contesting against he’s not in Edo, he is Abuja. “It is unfortunate, the position he (Adams Oshiomhole) has taken I believe that he was misguided, well not properly guided and as governor, his governor, it is my responsibility to seek peace for my state and with all my citizens. “I will continue to strive for peace, I’ll continue to pursue peace, seek and interest of our people. I’m open, I will always call that we should talk about how to move things forward. We cannot turn back the hands of the clock. So, there are certain things we just must accept and see how we can move forward."
