National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has insisted that the party will use the direct primary system to select its governorship candidate in Edo State. He revealed this in Abuja on Monday shortly after a meeting with some serving governors elected on the partyâ€™s platform. He said Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo did not reject the direct primary officially. However, a source, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said that the decision on the mode of primary did not go down well with Obaseki as claimed by Oshiomhole. He added that the party may summon another meeting before the primary election in the state.
