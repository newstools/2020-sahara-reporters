The Social Democratic Party in Ondo State has been embroiled in a leadership crisis with less than five months to the governorship election in the state. The crisis followed the dissolution of the State Executive Council of the party led by Mr Korede Duyile by its National Working Committee. SaharaReporters learnt that the NWC had immediately put in place a caretaker committee to run the affairs of the party in preparation for the governorship poll. The committee include Mr Oladele Ogunbameru as chairman and Mr Ebenezer Adeniyan as secretary. But the dissolved State Working Committee soon fought back after accepting the letter on the dissolution and suspension its Deputy National Chairman, Dr Olu Agunloye. Olu Agunloye Announcing the suspension of Agunloye, the Publicity Secretary of the SDP in the state, Mr Remi Olayiwola, said that Agunloye was suspended for "gross anti party activities and deficit tendency against the party", stressing that his suspension had been ratified by the SWC of the party. Responding, Agunloye described the action of members of the dissolved SWC as nullity and of no effect. Agunloye said the tenure of the dissolved SWC had expired and that they had no power to suspend him from the party since the National Working Committee had set up a caretaker committee. He said the NWC decided to set up a caretaker committee since their time had elapsed and there was also the need to inject young blood into the party. According to him, the NWC had already hinted the Independent National Electoral Commission of its plan to participate in the gubernatorial elections in Ondo and Edo states later this year.
