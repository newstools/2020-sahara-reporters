A socio-cultural group, Oodua Action Movement, has called on the Yoruba to use the occasion of June 12, Nigeria’s Democracy Day, to be more united as a people. In a statement by its Coordinator, Mr Demola Edward, the group said this was the best time for the Yorubas to speak with one voice in order to secede from Nigeria. 

MKO Abiola The statement reads, “It is imperative that all Yoruba people globally should come together now to actualise Oodua nation in order to have the desired and deserved relief from governance in Nigeria.” Edward said Nigeria had continued to be in the league of “failed nations” because of its present unitary structure, which had significantly inhibited its growth and prospects. He added, “We therefore demand on behalf of Yoruba worldwide, our rights to self-determination and claim our God-given rights to determine our destiny through self-government. “We are ready to work with the Federal Government of Nigeria to achieve this mission with peace and due respect to other ethnic units within the Nigeria entity.”
