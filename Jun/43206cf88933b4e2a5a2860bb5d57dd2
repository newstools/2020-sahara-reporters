Managing Director of Nigeria Incentive-based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending, Mr Aliyu A. Abdulhameed, on Wednesday dismissed another staff of the organisation, Olusola Omole, in a bid to conceal the monument corruption taking place under his watch. Omole was head of a technical unit with responsibility across the 36 states of the federation before he was removed. Abdulhameed is notorious for reckless spending and fights dirty with anyone, who challenges him, according to those close to him. 

Aliyu A. Abdulhameed Omole got into trouble with the NIRSAL boss after he was sighted walking alongside the former Head of Internal Audit, Olalekan Olusanya, within the premises of the agency. SaharaReporters had earlier reported how Olusanya was dismissed by the MD for refusing to help hide his fraudulent activities. Our correspondent reliably gathered that Omole was not given the chance for fair hearing before his dismissal on Wednesday. Omole was accused of violating NIRSAL's confidentiality and secrecy agreement. He was never issued a query or made to face any disciplinary panel over the allegations before his dismissal. NIRSAL is a $500m non-bank financial institution, a creation of the Central Bank of Nigeria mandated to manage agribusiness-related credit risks in Nigeria. Aliyu had been siphoning money from the establishment since he was appointed to office in 2015. Insiders informed SaharaReporters that this was not the first time Aliyu would sack people for doing nothing wrong. In July 2017, seven employees of NIRSAL, who were all employed three months earlier, were sacked unceremoniously after the MD alleged that they were not be loyal to him.
