The police in Delta State, Sapele Divisional Headquarters, have arrested a 38-year-old man for allegedly drugging and raping a 12-year-old girl. SaharaReporters learnt that the man identified as Maximum Akpojotor on Tuesday afternoon allegedly drugged and raped the girl in his one-room apartment along Abeke Road just before Jehovah Witness Hall in Sapele. The girl, it was gathered, is currently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in the area. A source close to the girl's family narrated that the suspect used to be a very close family friend to the victim. "The barber does visit the victim's family and the victim and her brothers used to go to Akpojotor saloon to charge their phones and at times the victim do visit him at home as well. “But on Tuesday, Akpojotor had invited the 12-year-old girl to his house and gave her a meal laced with some substances believed to be marijuana and raped her. It was after he had raped her that the girl woke up, still feeling dizzy and ran out naked, shouting for help. "The alarm attracted neighbours who alerted the girl's parents who came and saw the state of their daughter. It was based on this that the parents immediately invited the police who in turn arrested Akpojotor while the girl is currently receiving treatment at the Sapele Police Clinic,” the source said. Calls to the Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, were not answered, but a police officer attached to the Sapele Division confirmed the story. “The story is true. We have in our custody a barber, one Maximum, for drugging and raping an under-aged girl and the girl is presently on admission at the police clinic," the officer said.
