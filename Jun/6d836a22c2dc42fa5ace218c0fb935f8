Tehran prosecutor, Ali Alqasimehr, said the United States President and more than 30 others face "murder and terrorism charges” for the January 3 air strike at Baghdad International Airport, according to the ISNA news agency. Recall that the US military killed Soleimani in an air strike outside Baghdad international airport. His death however, sparked protests around the world. His recruits operated as a combination of spies and special forces, and are long suspected of being behind actions to destabilise the Middle East. Miffed by Soleimani’s death, Iranian Revolutionary Guards vowed to attack Israel and other United States allies in revenge of US action. See Also
