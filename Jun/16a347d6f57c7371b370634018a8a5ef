The Nigeria Police Force have been accused of demanding money from the family of a female student of the University of Benin, Vera Uwaila Omozuwa, who was raped and killed while reading inside a church in Edo State, before commencing investigation into the matter. In a video obtained by SaharaReporters, sister of the deceased, who spoke with journalists, said some police officers asked them to pay mobilisation fee when the matter was reported to them before they can commence investigation into the case. The lady said, “I saw a post on social media that police said they called my father but my father refused to come to the station. “My father went there several times. The police even insulted him that he was a foolish man, that he was not the first that his daughter would be raped. "They said they needed mobility money before they can do their job in investigating the death of my sister. "Some are even saying my sister incident happened on 14th May, my sister incident did not happen on 14th May, it happened on Wednesday, May 27, and she died on Saturday night May 30.”
