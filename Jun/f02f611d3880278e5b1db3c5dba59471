Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, has suspended the reopening of worship centers in the state indefinitely. Abiodun had earlier fixed June 19 for the planned reopening of worship centres in the state and had set up a tripartite committee to work out the modalities for the reopening. But on Friday, the governor made a U-turn, saying they should remain shut to check the spread of Coronavirus. He said, “Consequently, we are confronted with two choices – yield to the demand of those who want the restrictions to be further relaxed or even completely removed, even if this is at variance with the dictates of incontrovertible data analysis and scientific opinion; or tow the path that preserves public health and safety, even if not so popular. “As a responsible administration, we choose life and the wellbeing of our citizens and are therefore constrained to take the painful but necessary decision to maintain the current regime of eased lockdown in the meantime. “We are consequently suspending our initially slated reopening of places of worship.”
