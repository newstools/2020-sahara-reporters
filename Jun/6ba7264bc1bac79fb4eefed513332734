Rwanda announced its first Coronavirus after a 65-year-old truck driver, who chose to return to the country from a neighbouring state after falling ill, passed away. According to information from the country’s Ministry of Health, the individual was receiving treatment at a specialised COVID-19 treatment facility when he died. In addition to the death of the patient, the country recorded four new cases on Saturday, bringing to 359 the number of infected persons in the country. Rwanda began lifting the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the virus on May 4, allowing businesses to resume with essential staff. The country of an estimated 13 million people has so far conducted 66,976 tests, more than Nigeria’s 58,726 but have recorded fewer cases, meaning the level of containment has been more effective.
