An Akwa Ibom-based civil rights activist, Nsikak Akai, has dragged the state government to the Akwa Ibom State High Court over the illegal reappointment of Prof. Eno James Ibanga as Acting Vice-Chancellor of the Akwa Ibom State University. In an originating summon obtained by Sahara Reporters, Akai accused Governor Udom Emmanuel and the Attorney General of Akwa Ibom State, Uwemedimo Nwoko, of flouting the Akwa Ibom State University Law 2009, which prohibits the reappointment of an incumbent Vice-Chancellor until five years after he leaves office.  On March 9, 2015, Prof. Eno James Ibanga was initially appointed acting Vice-Chancellor of the Akwa Ibom State University. He was subsequently confirmed as substantive vice-chancellor on April 23 2015. His tenure expired April 22, 2020, but instead of complying with the Akwa Ibom State University Law, the governor reappointed him as acting vice-chancellor. The activist prays the court to “nullify the reappointment of Prof Eno James Ibanga as vice-chancellor of the institution, and asks for a refund of salaries and allowances received by him during his stay as acting vice-chancellor.” Akai demanded that the governor should abide by his oath of office wherein he swore to uphold the law and comply with the Akwa Ibom State University Law 2009.
