A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered the remand of Rotimi Jolayemi, also known as Oba Akewi, the journalist, who sang a poem critical of Lai Mohammed, Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture. The court ordered Jolayemi to be remanded by the Nigeria Police Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department headquarters, Area 10, Abuja, after he was arraigned in court on Thursday in suit number: FHC/ABJ/CB/104/2020. Joseph Offor led the prosecution while two lawyers, Soji Toki and RO Adakole, appeared for Jolayemi. Jolayemi had earlier been charged for acting in a manner, which caused ‘annoyance’ and ‘hatred’ to the Minister of Information and Culture in contravention of Section 24(b) of the Cybercrimes Act, 2015. Many Nigerians have described the charge as laughable. At the resumed hearing on Thursday, Offor applied to the court to amend the charge sheet against Jolayemi. Offor, asking the court to amend the charges, also sought for the permission of the court to add additional list of witnesses. Jolayemi's counsel the defendant did not oppose the application.  SaharaReporters confirms that after the charge sheet was amended, Jolayemi pleaded not guilty to all six new charges against him. However, despite Jolayemi's complain about ill-health, which also was confirmed by the police, Offor urged the court to remand Jolayemi in a correctional facility. The court adjourned the case to June 16, 2020 but ordered the remand of Jolayemi to the Force headquarters, Area 10, Abuja pending when his bail application would be taken to continue his treatment.
