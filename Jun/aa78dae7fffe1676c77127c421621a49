His lawyer Francis, Xavier Sosu, said the charges are "baseless", adding that the protest leader did not break the law because police were notified in advance.At Saturday's rally in Ghana's capital, Accra, the protesters were also highlighting police brutality in the West African country.They chanted: "We are not free until we are all free."A joint police and military team forcibly dispersed the crowd on Saturday before arresting Yeboah.When his fellow protesters demanded his release, police fired warning shots.
