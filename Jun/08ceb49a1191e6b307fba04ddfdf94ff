He said, “I am against the slaughtering of Christians from Southern Zaria. I am against the persecution and killing of people from any ethnic group in Nigeria. That is what we are against.“We must stand-up to condemn evil and speak at all times truth. That is why I revered the legendary musician Fela Kuti because he spoke the truth.“Allow the people to decide where they want to belong. After all Alaska is nearer Canada but they decided to be in the United States.”  See Also
