The police called off the protest as the group gathered and prepared to move. The organisers said they received a call from the Otukpo Area Commander asking them to cancel the protest due to security threat in the state. 

Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu “We got an instruction early this morning while trying to step out for the awareness rally that we should stand it down. “An order came in from the Otukpo Area Commander, ACP Emmanuel Ighodabo, that the proposed awareness should be put on hold for security reason. “In as much as we have perfected every other arrangement, including sending notice to the various security agencies and coordinating various participating organizations, including the press, most of whom are already in town; we could not but respect the order given,” said one of the organisers of the protest, Comrade Prince Yemi Itodo.
