Retired boxing star, Floyd Mayweather Jr. has offered to cover the costs of all four funerals planned for George Floyd, according to multiple media reports. Hollywood Unlocked was the first to report the news, with the website’s CEO Jason Lee on Monday revealing a private discussion with Mayweather on the matter.  TMZ confirmed that Mayweather offered to pay for services for Floyd in Houston, Minnesota and Charlotte, as well as another that Floyd’s family hopes to hold at a yet-to-be-named location. Floyd died a week ago in Minneapolis after being pinned with a police officer’s knee on his neck for several minutes. Officer Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with Floyd’s murder. The tragedy has sparked protests and riots around the country, including the Los Angeles area.
