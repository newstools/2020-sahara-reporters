After their no guilty plea, prosecution counsel, G. G. Chia-Yakua, asked the court for a date for the commencement of trial and also sought an order of the court to remand the defendants in a Nigeria Correctional Services centre. However, the defence counsel prayed the court to grant them bail on liberal terms or on self-recognisance, adding that they would always be available in court to face trial. Justice Itodo admitted them to bail on self-recognisance and thereafter adjourned the case until July 6, 7, and 8, 2020, for commencement of trial.
