Spokesperson for the Coalition of United Political Parties, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, has called on lawmakers to commence impeachment proceedings against Speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, because he was not fit to occupy the position. The coalition had recently alleged that lawmakers in the House of Representatives were offered $10m for the speedy passage of the Vaccination Bill by the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates. Ugochinyere disclosed this on Thursday in Abuja while reacting to an order by the House that the Department of State Services and police should investigate and arrest him. Ugochinyere said he had obtained a court order restraining the police and DSS from arresting or detaining him. He said Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, while ruling on the suit number FCT/HC/BW/CV/120/2020, barred the security operatives from arresting him. He said, “Let all the good men and women in the House of Representatives rise up and force the Speaker who is unfit for the office to step down so that the image of the House can be rebuilt before Nigerians. "In less than 24 hours of misleading the House to pass a resolution directing the Inspector-General of Police and Director-General of the DSS to arrest me, the opposition spokesperson, the FCT High Court in a landmark ruling has barred the police IG and DSS from arresting or detaining me in any manner."
