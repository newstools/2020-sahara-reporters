The Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday ordered the release of a former governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, from prison. Justice Mohammed Liman had fixed June 2 to hear a motion on notice filed by Kalu seeking release from prison based on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Udeogu’s appeal. In his application through his counsel, Chief Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), the former governor asked the court to order his release from the custody of the Nigeria Correctional Service, Kuje, Abuja, following the nullification of his conviction by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in a May 8, 2020 judgment nullified the trial and conviction of Kalu and others on the grounds that the judge, who handled the case lacked jurisdiction. On December 5, 2019, Kalu was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment while Udeogu got a 10-year sentence.
