The Adamawa State Government has been urged to promulgate laws that will help curb deforestation and promote the planting of at least one million trees annually in order to reduce the effects of climate change in the state. Yohanna Moses of the Environmental Care Foundation made the call on Friday during a tree planting campaign to mark the 2020 World Environment Day in Yola, the state capital. He said, "We are happy to celebrate this year's World Environment Day this way despite the raging COVID-19 pandemic. "Initially, we had thought the global health challenge was going to disrupt the event but we later reasoned that the pandemic provides the justification to mark the day. "Moving ahead, we're going to sustain the momentum by planting one million trees every year. "Therefore, we're looking into how we can come up with a bill on deforestation and climate change in Adamawa State.‚Äù
