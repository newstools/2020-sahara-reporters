Parents and teachers have reacted to the poor state of facilities at the Ikaro High School, Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State. They urged the state government to come to the aid of the school by overhauling its infrastructures to make it conducive for learning. SaharaReporters observed that the Ikaro High School, which was established in 1979, had been taken over by weeds while some of its structures have been weakened and also cracked. Some of the parents, who spoke in an interview on Monday, said the classrooms are already leaking and normally flooded when it rained. A community leader and a parent, Mr Joseph Ayiloge, complained bitterly about the state of the school, urging the government to intervene. Ayiloge revealed that some of the classes in the school, which he said has up to 2,000 students, had become a hideout for hoodlums. He said, "The high school, like many others, has become a shadow of itself and even posed a big threat to the lives of students and teachers. The deplorable condition of the school is just too alarming especially now that students would soon resume for normal academics.‚Äù A teacher in the school, who didn't want his name published, told our correspondent that they had written several letters to call the attention of the Ministry of Education in the state to the plight of students and the condition of the school. An educationist, Mr Martins Alo, lamented the dilapidated condition of the school facilities, stating that it requires total overhauling. Femi Agagu, the Commissioner for Education in the state, was not reachable on the phone when contacted on Monday. One of the education secretaries in the ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the state government had already taken inventory of the schools facing similar challenges.
