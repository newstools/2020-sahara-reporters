The Federal High Court in Abuja, on Wednesday, extended the interim order barring Governor Godwin Obaseki from arresting the suspended National Chairman of the All Progressive Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, over his alleged indictment by a panel of inquiry. Justice Ahmed Mohammed ordered all the parties involved in the matter to stay action till June 29 when the court would hear a motion challenging its jurisdiction to entertain an application Oshiomhole filed for the protection of his fundamental human rights.  Other respondents in the matter are; Edo State government, the Attorney- General and Commissioner of Justice of Edo state, Chairman of the panel of inquiry, Justice J. Oyomire, the Inspector General of Police and the Department of State Service. It will be recalled that the court had, in a ruling on June 1, restrained both Governor Obaseki and the other respondents from taking steps to arrest Oshiomhole, over the report of the Justice Oyomire-led panel that indicted him for corruption and diversion of public funds. Trial Justice Mohammed directed the parties to maintain the status quo, pending the determination of the issue of jurisdiction.
