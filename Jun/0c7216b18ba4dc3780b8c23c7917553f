President Muhammadu Buhari is in a closed-door meeting at Aso Villa with President of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina. This is coming shortly after the United States demanded a fresh probe of Adesina over allegations levelled against him. He was accused by a group of unidentified whistleblowers of handing contracts to acquaintances and appointing relatives to strategic positions at the Abidjan-based lender. The Nigerian Government through Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, and 14 ex-Presidents including Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan have also expressed support for Adesina. In separate letters, they said an independent probe is not provided for in AfDB governing procedures after the bank’s ethics committee cleared Adesina of all charges. See Also
