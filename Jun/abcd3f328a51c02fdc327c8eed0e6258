President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the nomination of a former Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, for the position of Director-General of the World Trade Organisation. TheCable reported on Thursday that Buhari withdrew the candidacy of Yonov Agah, Nigeria’s permanent representative to the WTO, for the same position. The election is scheduled to hold in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2021 for a four-year term that would run from 2021 to 2025 after former Director-General of the organisation, Roberto Azevedo, stepped down a year to the end of his second term.
