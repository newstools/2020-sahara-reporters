This illegal detention is one of the numerous benefits of being a soldier of truth and apostle of the rule of law. "We were not cowed, neither did we negotiate nor trade off our right to free speech as our oppressors desired. We have come out stronger and more determined. "I was shown a petition authored and engineered by the lawless Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives forwarding a resolution of the House where the police was directed to arrest me following the comments I made about the shady attempt to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill.!
