The Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, on Wednesday adjourned the case of rights activist and journalist, Mr Omoyele Sowore, seeking variation to his bail condition. Sowore was represented by one of his lawyers, Abubakar Marshal, from the Femi Falana chamber. Kayode Aliyu, Senior State Counsel from the Ministry of Justice, appeared for the Department of State Services.Â 





Sowore is asking the Court of Appeal to review the bail conditions set by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, which confines him to Abuja and forbids him from speaking to the press. The bail condition has been described as absurd. At the hearing, Justice Adamu Jauro leading a panel of two other justices, held that the preliminary objection of the DSS was not filed alongside any respondent's brief of argument, which is against the practice of the court and therefore incompetent. As a result, the court adjourned the case until July 8, 2020 to allow Aliyu file every necessary court processes. However, a mild drama unfolded at the exit of the court when some police officers and court personnel harassed Sowore's supporters for using mobile phones within the court premises.  Calm was later restored after Chief Registrar of the court visited the scene and pleaded with all parties to maintain peace.
