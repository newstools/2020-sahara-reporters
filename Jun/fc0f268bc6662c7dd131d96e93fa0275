Khadijah, wife of Abubakar Idris popularly known as Dadiyata, a social critic with appreciable following, has called for his immediate release. Khadijat highlighted the pain the family had been through since her husband’s abduction over 300 days ago by gunmen at his Kaduna residence. Dadiyata has been missing since August 2, 2019 when unidentified men seized him from his residence in Barnawa neighbourhood in Kaduna State. According to the account given by the police, he was returning home at about 1:00am when some armed men breached his house’s security and took him away in his BMW car. Till date, he and the vehicle had not been found. Dadiyata, 34, a lecturer at the Federal University Dutsinma, Katsina State, was initially suspected to have been arrested by the Department of State Services. Activists and rights groups have been making appeal to the Nigerian Government to determine the whereabouts of Dadiyata, who many see as a victim of enforced disapperance, which is a tactic of political repression prevalent in failed states and dictatorships. While urging her husband to remain resolute, Khadijat said, “Alhamdulillah for a blissful seven years of marriage. “We are here for you, we love you forever. You are strong, and I believe we will overcome all of these insha Allah. Let’s hope and pray for the best.”
