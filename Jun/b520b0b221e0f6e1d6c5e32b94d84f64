The Ondo State Police Command has launched a manhunt for the attackers of a 70-year-old farmer, Raphel Osayintuyi, who was killed in Akoko area of the state. Osayintuyi was found dead on his farm in Orin Akoko, in Akoko North West Local Government Area of the state at the weekend by some residents of the local community.  Sources claimed the local farmer was hacked to death by some herdsmen wandering the bush. The herdsmen had been accused of destroying cash crops and farmlands in the community. Speaking in a phone interview with SaharaReporters on Monday, Mr Tee Leo Ikoro, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, said a team of policemen had been sent to investigate the murder. Ikoro said the corpse of Osayintuyi had been evacuated to the hospital morgue. "By the time we arrest those behind the attack, we would ensure they face the law and we shall charge them to court for prosecution,” he said. Meanwhile, the family of the deceased have appealed to the state government and the police to assist them to get justice for their late father. One of the daughters of the late Osayintuyi, who spoke with our correspondent on the phone, called on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to intervene in the case and ensure that the police did not sweep the matter under the carpet. "We know that he (Osayintuyi) is old but nobody is praying to lose his or her loved ones even when they are still relevant in life. "We are tired of incessant killings of our people by these uninvited visitors parading themselves as herdsmen in our community and we want justice,” she said.
