Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Etsako Ward 10, Edo State, Mr Oshawo Stephen, has dismissed claims that the suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as a member of the party had been lifted, insisting that the ward executives stand by their suspension of the erstwhile National Chairman of the APC. In a statement, Stephen said the ward executives, who were elected into office in 2018, remain intact and had not been displaced by anybody, describing the claims of the lifting of the suspension as a charade. He said, “The suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole by the ward executives remains valid. The statements to the contrary in the media are false and should be disregarded. We stand by our decision and have no reservation on the action as it is in the best interest of the party.
