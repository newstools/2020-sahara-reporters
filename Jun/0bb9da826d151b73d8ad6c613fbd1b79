Less than a week after killing 74 people across four villages under Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State, gunmen on Saturday night again attacked Gatawa Village and killed three persons and abducted two others. The attack equally left many people including women and children injured.  Those killed were buried on Sunday amidst tears. Immediately after the funeral, more people fled the village for fear of another attack by the gunmen. Frequent attacks by armed hoodlums have displaced hundreds of people across the region in recent times.  Many of the displaced persons have been moving around Sabon Birni town looking for shelter and begging for food.Â
