Many persons have been feared killed after a violent clash between two tribes in Adamawa State. It was gathered that indigenous 'Lunguda' tribe and their 'Waja' settlers in Lafiya town under Lamurde Local Government Area of the state engaged each other in overnight violent confrontation. It was further learnt that over five villages including Momsurmi, Boshikiri, Zakawon and Burti have been burnt to ashes as a result of the violence. Domestic animals and foodstuffs were also destroyed in the mayhem, which lasted several hours before the military brought the situation under control. The conflict was said to have been sparked by dispute over farmland ownership before leading to the destruction of lives and property worth millions of naira. Adamawa State deputy governor, Crowther Seth, in company with the Brigade Commander of the 23 Brigade, Yola, Brigadier General Sani Gambo Mohammed, visited the scene in the early hours of Wednesday. The deputy governor, who assured that government will investigate and bring perpetrators to book, warned against further escalation of violence. Recall that last month, over 48 lives were lost in a similar communal clash in Tingno under the same local government area.
