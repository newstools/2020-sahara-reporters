A civil society group, Act for Positive Transformation Initiative, has called for investigation into claims by the Niger Delta Development Commission officials that some employees of the commission tested positive for COVID-19. In a statement on Sunday, Head, Directorate of Research, Strategy and Programmes of the organisation, Mr Kolawole Johnson, called on the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to investigate the claim. The statement reads, “We submit that this whole ploy is meant to jeopardize the ongoing probe of the commission. Our curiosity is further heightened by the slow pace of work by the National Assembly. There must not be any political settlement on the wicked rape of the people’s resources.
