COVID-19 volunteers in the Federal Capital Territory have downed tools to protest the non-payment of three months allowances by the Nigerian Government. Members of the Federal Capital Territory COVID-19 emergency response team took the protest to the Public Health Department office, Area 3, Garki, Abuja, demanding that the outstanding allowance be paid before they return to work. SaharaReportersÂ had earlier reported that the volunteers were yet to receive any money from the government. It was gathered that the volunteers numbering over 300 were to be given a stipend to cover for their transportation and feeding while working. Sources confirmed that the volunteers especially those working in Lagos State are currently considering downing tools in protest of the non-payment. Those, who protested the non-payment in Abuja, include sample collectors, case investigators, ambulance drivers, environmental health workers, temperature readers and cleaners. The country's Ministry of Health is yet to respond to inquiries on the status of the payment of COVID-19 volunteers.
