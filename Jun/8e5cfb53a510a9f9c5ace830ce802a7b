Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, has called for a police reform policy in the United States following the death of George Floyd. Jack, who recently had a spat with President Donald Trump for his comments on those protesting Floyd's death, said his company would continue to demand a reform of the police.  "Police policy reform now. Our company demands police policy reform now," Jack tweeted. Dorsey, who is also the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company, demanded an end to racism and police brutality of African-Americans. "We stand with our Black employees, our customers, and the Black community in demanding an end to systemic racism and police brutality," Square tweeted adding that there is much to do to right society’s long history of wrongs against Black communities. "We can put out statements all day, but we know that words alone can feel quaint. Real, meaningful work is necessary to create change,"  the company added.
