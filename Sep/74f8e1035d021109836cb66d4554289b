The Nigerian Army has sponsored a movie shooting in Enugu State aimed at depicting the Islamic Movement in Nigeria as a terrorist organisation. In the movie, popular Nollywood actor, Pete Edochie, was featured in a role with outfit resembling Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, leader of the IMN, who has been in detention since December 2015.  There are plans to feature the movie on Netflix, a source told SaharaReporters. The movie production is part of a cover up of the December 2015 massacre of Shiites by Nigerian soldiers. Over 348 people were said to have been killed, with 347 bodies secretly buried by the army in a mass grave.  The incident is considered among the notable human rights violation since the return to democracy in Nigeria. El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, were arrested days after the killings and have been in detention despite different court orders granting them bail.
