"Government has also directed the committee to close down private schools operating below approved standards. “What we have done is to ensure that the lost time is regained. Therefore, the government of Bayelsa State under the leadership of Senator Douye Diri has decided with all critical stakeholders that all schools, both public and private and all tertiary institutions, should resume for classes from the 5th of October 2020. “It has also come to the notice of the government that many private schools are not up to standard and the governor directed the Ministry of Education to shut down such schools.”
