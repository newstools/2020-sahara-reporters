Bako was Commander of Sector 2, Operation Lafiya Dole, the team combating terrorism in the North-East region of the country before he was killed.

2 Days Ago Three other soldiers killed alongside Bako were not recognized nor given any respect or befitting burial. The identities of the three fallen soldiers are Lance Corporal Oluwaseyi, Lance Corporal Nwobuji Desmond and Private Aliyu Ibrahim. It was reported that their family was not also given any official condolence by the military. An insider, who spoke with HumAngle, stated that by this, authorities continually alienate their subordinates and fail to show patriotic examples in leadership.
