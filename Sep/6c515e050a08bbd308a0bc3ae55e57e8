She noted that the government imposed the decision at the wrong time, as she called on the people to stand up against the move. She said, “To choose a moment when governments around the world are looking for ways to make life bearable for their peoples in the midst of Coronavirus cannot be an attitude reflective of a caring government. “These steps are not acceptable and should not be accepted. Nigerians are encouraged to rediscover themselves and say clear no to these measures. “While the Buhari government should have taken the respite offered by the patience of the people as golden opportunity to fulfill its election promises of a better life for Nigerians, it should not take it as liberty to continue to inflict further hardship on the people.”
