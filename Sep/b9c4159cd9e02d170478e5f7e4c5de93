13 Hours Ago Ortom stated that the military were carried along in the amnesty programme for militias in the state. He said, “We were waiting for the repentant militias when I received a call that Gana and others have been arrested close to Yandev Roundabout in Gboko by soldiers. “Many of the repentant militias had weapons in which they were bringing to surrender to us. “The process of the amnesty programme was known to the security operatives, so I don’t know why they have to be arrested." The Commander, 4 Special Forces Command, Doma, Nasarawa State, Major General Moundhey Ali, told newsmen on Tuesday that Gana was killed at a roadblock mounted by the army along Gbese-Gboko-Makurdi Road following exchange of gunfire. Ali said about 40 members of Gana’s gang were captured in the process. The Benue State Government had in 2015 granted amnesty to over 500 persons including Gana, who were terrorising parts of Benue and Taraba states, but most of them relapsed into criminality. Gana was later in 2017 declared wanted by the police while the Benue State Government placed a N10m bounty on him.
