They should vote for good governance, common decency, principled leadership, especially in the political arena and the protection of their democratic rights. “They should by their votes make clear that it is their right to choose their governor and nobody else’s. There is no room for fence sitters. This is a special situation and primitive loyalties should and must be set aside. Remember Mr President’s admonition in an equally challenging pre-election situation in Imo State, “vote your conscience,” he said. See Also
