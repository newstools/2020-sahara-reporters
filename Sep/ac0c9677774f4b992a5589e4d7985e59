A former Deputy Governor of Central Bank, Obadiah Mailafia, was invited twice for questioning by the DSS after revealing that he had information on how a serving state governor in the Northern part of Nigeria is the commander of the Boko Haram terror group. Mailafia has asked Nigerians to pray for his safety as his life had come under severe threat since making that revelation.
