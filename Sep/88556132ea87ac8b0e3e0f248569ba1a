Nigeria's Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has erected a multi-million mansion in his native Katsina. The building, discovered to have been erected within few months, is suspected to have been executed with suspected public funds. SaharaReporters gathered the sprawling edifice is located in Shargalle under Dutsi Local Government Area.  The minister in 2018 allegedly spent millions of naira to design a logo for the failed Nigeria Air project. In a petition to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria branch of the Nigerian Union of Pensioners asked the President to probe the financial commitment of Sirika to the suspended national carrier project. The union alleged that Sirika was secretive about the spending of government to the project, saying that once investigated, billions of naira expended on the failed project would be unearthed. Some stakeholders had alleged that for the logo design, which was awarded to a foreign firm, FROM6 Communication in Bahrain, cost the government a whopping $600,000 (about N219m). Besides, the Nigerian Government approved the sum of N1.524,492,863.62 to hire Transaction Advisers and other projects for the now suspended national carrier.
