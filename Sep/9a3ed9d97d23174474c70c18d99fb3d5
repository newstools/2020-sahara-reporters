Immediate-past governor of Delta State, Emmanuel Uduaghan, has dumped the All Progressives Congress for the Peoples Democratic Party. He switched sides at a ceremony on Monday at Abigborodo, Warri North Local Government Area of the state. Addressing his supporters after receiving his PDP membership card, Uduaghan said, "I am back to join forces with other party greats to strengthen our party, the largest party in Africa (PDP). "Having tasted the other side, it feels refreshing to be back home. Thank you all for receiving me back. It feels like I never left." Uduaghan had earlier defected from the PDP to APC to contest his senatorial district election but lost to James Manager of the PDP.
