Idy Enang, a Nigerian man on Twitter, has recounted how officials of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority damaged his car and refused to take responsibility for their action. Enang @IdyEnang in a series of tweets, photos and video on Thursday documented his exchange with the LASTMA officials, who were allegedly attempting to intimidate his driver from seeking damages through mob action. The officers driving an official van with registration number RTM 221 LA involved in the alleged intimidation, which took place at Oba Akran Area of Lagos and are attached to Zone 10 Maryland, are identified as Baderin A, Bakare S, Senior officer Badejoko among others.  Enang called on the Lagos State Government to investigate the matter, punish the officers involved and bear the cost of damages for his car. His tweets reads, “I just had the most bizarre incident @followlastma on Oba Akran as a band of irresponsible LASTMA guys bumped into my car and boldly came out to say they didn’t. They were extremely uncouth and were spoiling to fight my driver. “This was the most unbelievable scene. Blatant denial and a mob action from folks who are paid from taxpayers money. @followlasg if nothing is done to bring these guys to book and also effect repairs on my car, I will lose all respect for you @jidesanwoolu."  This was the most unbelievable scene. Blatant denial and a mob action from folks who are paid from tax payers money. @followlasg if nothing is done to bring these guys to book and also effect repairs on my car, I will lose all respect for you @jidesanwoolu pic.twitter.com/vWGbL3Gv22
