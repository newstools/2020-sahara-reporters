Candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Saturday's governorship election in Edo State, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has faulted the process that led to the emergence of Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party as winner. In a post on his verified Twitter account, Ize-Iyamu claimed his supporters were prevented from voting.  He said he was still studying the results along with other APC members and will announce his next move soon. “I thank and appreciate my supporters, who had to endure many evils including being prevented from voting, for their support and determination during the election. I assure you all that I am studying the results along with other party members and will announce my next move soon,” he said.
