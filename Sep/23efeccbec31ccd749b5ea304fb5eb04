Akinwumi Adesina has been sworn in for a second term in office as President of the African Development Bank. Adesina was sworn in on Tuesday at the AfDB headquarters in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, in an event that was broadcast virtually.  The former Nigerian Minister of Agriculture was reelected last week to serve a second five-year term, with a 100 per cent vote of all governors and regional and non-regional members of the bank. He is the first President to be elected by 100 percent of votes by regional and non-regional members of the bank. Adesina’s first term as President of Africa’s premier development finance institution comprising 54 regional and 27 non-regional member countries focused on five key development priorities tagged the 'High 5s'. These include Light up and Power Africa; Feed Africa; Industrialize Africa; Integrate Africa; and Improve the Quality of Life for the People of Africa.
