He’s killed yesterday (September 5) on duty at Birnin Gwari. He’s the Best Graduating Officer at the NAF Special Forces Course that held recently in Bauchi. “We’ve lost too many brave and promising men to the insecurity raging in our country. Government officials and politicians must face this problem head-on. They must channel the huge sums wasted on their extravagant lifestyle to this problem and ensure every kobo is spent transparently.”  PHOTO: Flying Officer Muhammad Auwal, One Of The Soldiers Killed By Boko Haram Terrorists On Saturday At Birnin Gwari, Kaduna State He is reportedly the best Graduating Officer at the @NigAirForce Special Forces Course recently held in Bauchi.#RestInPeaceAuwal pic.twitter.com/0geNgO71c9
