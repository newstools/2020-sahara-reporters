"I implore parents and guardians to counsel their children and wards to resist the unprofitable urge of being recruited by any politician for thuggery and other acts of violence. "The message here is clear. For the political actors and electorates that are law-abiding, they are fully assured of optimal security as they exercise their electoral rights. "However, for the deviants who despite all wise counsels are determined to deploy violence and other illegal means to advance their political interests, they should be prepared for the consequences of their actions as they will be decisively dealt with irrespective of their status or political affiliation."
