The commissioner explained that part of the deal reached with the bandits was that henceforth, they would not kidnap anybody, while the security agencies would not arrest any of their members unless if caught with weapons or any incriminating items. He revealed that the state government had awarded a contract for the construction of a dam at Kamarawa in view of the cessation of attacks following the deal reached with the bandits. “The construction would have commenced since but because of the renewed attacks and flooding in the area. “We are even planning to build grazing reserves and schools for their children,” he said.
