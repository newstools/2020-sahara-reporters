Three persons suspected to be part of a kidnap syndicate that had been terrorising the people of Ondo State have been arrested. The suspects were arrested by officials of Amotekun Corps on Wednesday afternoon before being handed over to the police.  They were apprehended after abducting a middle-aged man, Mr Kunle Agbayewa, in a popular sawmill at Owaani in Idoani, Ose Local Government Area of the state. Agbayewa was kidnapped barely 24 hours after the Chief Medical Director of the General Hospital, Idoani, Mr Olufemi Adeogun, and two other health workers, were abducted. SaharaReporters gathered that the suspects stormed the sawmill and seized Agbayewa at gunpoint before taking him him away. A resident of the community, Comfort Ilesanmi, who confirmed the abduction, said the suspects were Fulani herdsmen, who had been parading the area.
