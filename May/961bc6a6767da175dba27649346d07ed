Residents of Dapchi in Yobe State have described the attack on the community on Monday as the biggest so far carried out by Boko Haram militants. During the attack, the insurgents burnt down the palace of Dapchi District Head and the General Hospital.

Dapchi rose to global prominence on February 19, 2018 when the town was attacked by insurgents, who abducted 110 schoolgirls from their dormitory at Government Girls Science and Technical College. The girls were later released in a deal with the Nigerian Government but one of them, Leah Sharibu, was held back because she refused to convert from Christianity to Islam. Also in March, 2020, Boko Haram fighters attacked the town and killed seven policemen.
