Protest has erupted in Benue State after sensitive election materials intended for the conduct of elections in Obi Local Government Area of Benue State on Saturday were allegedly taken to the house of a politician, SaharaReporters can confirm. The materials were said to have been moved by staff of the Benue State Independent Electoral Commission to the house of one Samson Okwu, member representing Oju/Obi Federal Constituency in the National Assembly under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. An eyewitness at the scene of the protest said, "While everyone stood outside the BESIEC office waiting for the electoral officials to begin the process of identifying their ad-hoc staff, a PDP agent was granted access into the BESIEC office where the electoral materials were kept." The witness said the discovery that election materials had been moved to Okwu's house led to the protest by observers and agents from other parties participating in the elections. "Top electoral officers are heading to Samson Okwu's residence for negotiations. The LGA returning officer was trying to make his way out of the BESIEC premises under the pretext of going to take breakfast. He has been prevented from leaving members of the opposition parties present because of concerns he is going to the lawmakers house," the source added. Meanwhile, electoral officials have begun the identification of ad hoc staff, who will conduct the exercise in different wards.
