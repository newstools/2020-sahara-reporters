A yet-to-be-identified man has been killed after a vehicle crushed him to death on the Abeokuta-Sagamu Expressway in Ogun State. The car involved in the accident is a Honda Odyssey with registration number AAA 589 FV. Public Relations Officer of Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Babatunde Akinbiyi, told journalists on Wednesday that the incident happened around 11am in Abeokuta. He explained that the victim, according to an eyewitness, was on video call while crossing the road and got knocked down by the Honda car, the News Agency of Nigeria reports. He said, “We learnt a commercial car in which the deceased was driving in was on its way to Ajah in Lagos from Kuto park in Abeokuta when the driver noticed it had ran out of fuel. “The driver had to park by the roadside to go purchase fuel while passengers in the vehicle waited for his arrival. “Since there was a road diversion along the Abeokuta-Siun-Sagamu Interchange due to ongoing reconstruction, the deceased decided to cross to the other side of the road for safety. “However, when the driver of the Mazda car came back and had refilled the vehicle, the deceased, while crossing the road back to the car was making a video call oblivious of the fact that a vehicle was coming from the Sagamu end to Abeokuta. “The vehicle, which was a Honda Odyssey, hit him and he died on the spot.” Akinbiyi said the man’s corpse had been deposited at the morgue of the General Hospital, Ijaiye, Abeokuta.
