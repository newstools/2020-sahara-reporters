Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has urged Nigerians in China to continue to demand their right, noting that it was clear the Chinese do not want Africans in their country. The former lawmaker also urged China to respect the rights of Nigerians, noting that there were many illegal Chinese migrants in Nigeria, who are not being singled out for maltreatment by the Nigerian Government She spoke during a town hall meeting held via Zoom with Nigerians in the America's on Saturday. Among others, Dabiri-Erewa addressed questions on business, health and politics as it concerns Nigerians in the Diaspora. While reacting to a question on what the Nigerian Government was doing to address the discrimination and maltreatment of Nigerians in China, she said, “The issue of China has been recurring and I have been to the Chinese Embassy a couple of times, putting into consideration what has been happening to Nigerians in China. “I will be very realistic with the issue of Africans in China…what I am seeing is that they don’t want Africans in China. Some businessmen are stranded there but when you want to your home, they don’t allow you. In China, if you don’t have a residence, you can’t get a permit.” Dabiri-Erewa noted that talks were ongoing to address the maltreatment. She urged Nigerians to obey the laws of the Chinese Government and try to stay out of trouble. She added, “It is still tough for Nigerians in China. It (maltreatment) is still going on and it has to be dealt with. Right now, there is a little bit of sanity but we don’t know how long it will last but there has to be a permanent solution to the issue of blacks being maltreated in China. “We need to build a world of peace and love. There has to be reciprocity: Respect me and I respect you, treat me well and I treat you well. They should demand their right and obey their laws too but the laws should not be discriminatory.”
