Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, has approved the appointment of the district head of Kibiya, Kabiru Inuwa, as the new Emir of Rano. The Rano Emirate is one of the four emirates created by Ganduje when he dismantled the Kano Emirate. The appointment follows the death of the former emir, Alhaji Tafida Abubakar Ila Auta Bawo, who reportedly died of COVID-19. The announcement was made on Tuesday after the kingmakers forwarded names of three persons to the state governor. Ganduje charged the new emir to be just and fair to his subjects.
