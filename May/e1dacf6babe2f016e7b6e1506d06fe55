The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ekiti Command, has intercepted a bus, which sneaked into Ekiti State with some traders. The traders were alleged to have come from Sokoto State under false pretences that they were traders from Ilorin, Kwara State, to sell onions. Mr Solomon Iyamu, Commandant of NSCDC in the state, made this known in a statement by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Tolulope Afolab,i in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, on Thursday.

Google Iyamu said the suspects were arrested at Afao-Ekiti in Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government Area of Ekiti having travelled through bush paths and abandoned roads from Ilorin to Ado Ekiti at night. “Luck ran out of the suspects when the Intelligence Unit of the command traced them from Igbemo-Ekiti to Afao Ekiti, all in Irepodun/Ifelodun LGA where the commuter bus was about to disembark the passengers,” Iyamu said. The NSCDC boss said the driver of the commercial bus was able to escape on sighting armed personnel of the command. “The suspects were rounded up and detained at the headquarters of the Command in Ado Ekiti,’’ he said. He however, frowned at the rate at, which people moved into Ekiti from other states through bush paths and dangerous routes despite the boundary closure. Iyamu noted that preliminary investigation showed that the suspects were from Sokoto State while few of them had been staying in Ilorin before moving to Ekiti. According to him, all the persons have been handed over to the Ekiti Government for necessary action. The commandant also appealed to the people of the state to learn how to stay safe as the virus spreads.
