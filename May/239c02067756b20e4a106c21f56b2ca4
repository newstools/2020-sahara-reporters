The Federal Capital Territory Ministerial Task Force on Enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions has arrested 74 persons and three buses travelling through the city to other parts of the country. Chairman of the team, Ikharo Attah, disclosed that his team had earlier arrested one of the bus drivers, James Adegbe, while travelling from Kaduna to Kogi State. He said those apprehended were travelling in two trucks and seven other buses. He called on state governments to comply and enforce the interstate lockdown order. Attah said, “The FCT Administration working closely with the security agencies will continue to ensure sustainability of the interstate travel ban as placed by the President and Commander in Chief. “We are worried that the number of inter-state travellers attempting to enter or pass through the FCT seems to be on the increase daily. “Sadly, some of those arrested do not seem to understand why we are arresting them. This, I believe is because they now see it as normal because of where they are coming from. “This is a presidential order and we must obey it to the letter until the ban is lifted.”
