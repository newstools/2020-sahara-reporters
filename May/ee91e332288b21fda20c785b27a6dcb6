Armed bandits have attacked Allawa Pandogari Road in Niger State kidnapping residents in the operation. The marauders shot at two moving trucks and caused carnage in their path. 

Gunmen "They kidnapped four people from Allawa and are now demanding ransom," a family member of one of the victims told SaharaReporters. Insecurity in Nigeria continues to rise with Boko Haram terrorists attacking in the North-East and kidnappers and bandits operating in areas like Kaduna and Niger states unhindered.
