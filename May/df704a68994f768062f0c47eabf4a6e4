Some COVID-19 patients at the Kwadon Isolation Centre, Yamaltu Deba Local Government Area of Gombe State, on Tuesday blocked the popular Gombe/ Biu Road. The patients were said to be protesting against government's negligence, inadequate food and medical attention in the isolation centre. A resident of the community, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said, “Yes, they have left the isolation center and are presently destroying people’s properties on the main highway. "It’s so sad, what could have led these patients into protesting against the government? I think government is not being truthful.” According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Gombe State currently has 96 confirmed cases of the virus. When contacted by SaharaReporters, Commissioner for Health in the state, Ahmed Gana, did not pick up his phone calls. However, an official of the state's Ministry of Health confirmed the situation to our correspondent. They are protecting against negligence, inadequate food and medical attention. Avoid Gombe - Biu Road for now!
