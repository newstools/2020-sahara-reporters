The Abia State Government has declared a COVID-19 patient, Emmanuel Ononiwu, wanted. Commissioner for Information in the state, John Okiyi Kalu, in a statement on Thursday said Ononiwu had refused to submit himself for appropriate medical management and isolation after testing positive for the virus. The statement reads, “Abia State Government hereby declares one Mr Emmanuel Ononiwu wanted as he tested positive to COVID-19 but refused to submit himself for appropriate medical management and isolation. 

Governor Okezie Ikpeazu “He escaped from a temporary holding facility in Aba prior to movement to an isolation center after being informed of his COVID-19 status. “All subsequent appeals made to him fell on deaf ears as he insisted that he will not turn himself in and has gone ahead to switch off his line along with that of his spouse who is also required to come in immediately for testing. His last tracked location was around Asa Triangle in Aba South LGA. “All those who had contact with him in the past 14 days are strongly advised to call 0700 2242 362 and submit themselves for testing.”
