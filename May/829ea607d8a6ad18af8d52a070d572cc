Archbishop Nicholas Duncan-Williams, the General Overseer of Action Chapel International, has said that the fear of Coronavirus was killing people more than the virus itself. Speaking to Paul Adom-Otchere on Good Evening Ghana on Tuesday, the Archbishop indicated that there was a lot of uncertainty and fear. He said, “Apart from the virus killing people, one of the things that are also killing and destroying a lot of people is the fear of COVID-19 because the fear of COVID-19 is being spread and is causing depression and a lot of anxiety and uncertainty." The archbishop said most of his congregation call him to complain of nightmares, strange dreams, which a lot of them have never had before. He added, “A lot of fear and panic and they are losing hope; they are losing faith because the word of God is what builds faith and gives hope of the things that God has said. So, we need to keep hope alive; we need to keep faith alive because for without faith we die or do not exist.” Duncan-Williams urged the Christian community, who believe that with their faith in God, they can't contract the virus to apply wisdom to their faith. He said, “I will say as a shepherd that we should follow all the protocols and do all the things that we’ve been told by science to do and still have faith that you’ll not get the virus and that even if you get it, it won’t kill you.” When asked whether there was a spirit behind the Coronavirus, the cleric answered in the affirmative but refused to name the kind of spirit behind it.
