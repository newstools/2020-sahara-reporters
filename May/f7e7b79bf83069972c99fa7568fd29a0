Medical students of the University of Lagos yet to be inducted after graduating from medical college have disagreed with management of the college for delaying a proposed “virtual induction” by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria. While the students favour the virtual ceremony to finally make it possible for them to start practicing as medical professionals more than seven months after they completed their time at the College of Medicine at Idi-Araba, they accused the Provost, Prof Afolabi Lesi, of wanting a physical and elaborate event at a yet to be announced date. Recall that SaharaReporters had reported how medical students at the college expressed concerns over the unwarranted delay in their induction into medical profession despite fulfilling all requirements. 

Medicine students A graduand, who spoke with SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity, claimed that all fees had been paid but the management had kept giving excuses for the delay. He added that when probed too much, the management give unrealistic dates for their induction. While speaking on the latest development on Friday, one of the affected medical students said, “All Prof Afolabi, the Provost, wants is party, which is very unnecessary at this time. “This is an induction that does not last two hours. It is not true that they are in talks with MDCN for a virtual induction. If that was the case, MDCN would do it the next day. “If he (Prof Afolabi Lesi) wants to release us for induction, from the information we have gathered, the council would get it done with immediate effect. “This is a very crucial period. The reason for the protracted delay cannot be unconnected with several racketeering going on, on the said induction day ceremony. We are not commodities please. Nigeria needs us.” The affected persons have vowed to embark on a protest soon if the induction was not conducted by the college’s management.
