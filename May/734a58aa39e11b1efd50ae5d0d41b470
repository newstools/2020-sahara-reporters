Yoruba socio-economic group, Afenifere, has accused the Federal Character Commission of lopsided appointments and discrimination against Southerners. In a statement on Wednesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Yinka Odumakin, Afenifere said the FCC was working to divide Nigeria along ethno-religious and regional lines. He said, "Though it is now a familiar pattern, Afenifere will not allow President Buhari to get away with yet another infraction at the Federal Character Commission.

SaharaReporters Media “The FCC, according to the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is meant to be the custodian of the principle of federal character and is saddled with the responsibility of ensuring that all federal agencies and parastatals in Nigeria respect and adhere to this principle. "According to the principle of federal character as contained in the Act governing the commission, leadership positions must be equally distributed between zones. “This simply means that the chairmanship position should, going by the principle of federal character and as stated in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, automatically, go to the Southern part of Nigeria.” The group therefore called on the Senate to reject the nominee for Chairman, Farida Dankaka, because it negated the principle of federal character.
