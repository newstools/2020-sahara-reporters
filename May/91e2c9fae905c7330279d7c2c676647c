Controversial Nigerian pastor and founder of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations, Temitope Joshua, has urged the United States to emulate China’s aggressive manufacturing initiatives which have made developing nations to depend on the Asian country for development. Joshua stated this on his official Facebook page on Sunday while reacting to the feud between China and the United States in a question and answer session. 

TB Joshua Asked what would happen if US President, Donald Trump, cut off ties with China, he stated, “America's concentration is on big things while China concentrates on small things e.g. manufacturing and agricultural goods – what developing nations need. Remember, 70-80 per cent of the world are developing nations. What they need to grow, to live and to improve is what China is concentrating on. I think America should learn this lesson. This is what they should turn to. “China is using all these little things to get money from developing nations – and that is making them the richest in the world. It is trade by barter. It has made developing nations to see China as their hope. “For example, a product in America may cost 500 and last long, because it is durable. The same product in China may cost 100 but not last long. However, developing nations will still choose China's products because such products are within their reach. That makes many nations to become debtors to China - even America.”
