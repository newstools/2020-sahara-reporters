Nigeria's Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has said that the losses experienced by airlines in the country due to the Coronavirus pandemic would swallow many airlines. Sirika made the comment while briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Wednesday. He said, “Certainly in civil aviation, we’re in very difficult moments like everyone else. All of this started because someone travelled. Unfortunately, he came back hone with it and the consequence is what we’ve been going through. “We are very aware of our responsibilities and the weight attached to this. We are worst hit among all the sectors. Some billions is being lost by the airlines monthly, thanks to COVID-19. The sector is highly regulated and very coordinated and has set standards that must be followed at all times, regardless, because we speak to safety. “This is the situation of civil aviation. It is really a pathetic one and I can guarantee you that several airlines won’t come out of this unfortunately.”
