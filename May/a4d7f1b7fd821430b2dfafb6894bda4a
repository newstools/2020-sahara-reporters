Ehanire added that 50 per cent of such persons did not show any symptoms of the disease. The minister stated this in a statement by the ministry’s Director of Information, Media and Public Relations, Eunice Akro, cautioning Nigerians to strictly observe the COVID-19 health regulations during Eid-el-Fitri celebration. He said, “Ehanire said that findings from the analysis of the deaths showed that nearly half of them died at home. “Of those who died at home, about 50 percent did not show any symptoms. This underscores my earlier emphasis on the need for those who test positive to report for treatment.”
