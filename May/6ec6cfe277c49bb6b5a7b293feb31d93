The management of Nigerian Navy School of Health Sciences, Offa, Kwara State, has refused to comply with the Nigerian Government’s directive that all educational institutions in the country be shut down over the Coronavirus outbreak. On March 22, the government in a precautionary move aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in the country, ordered the immediate closure of all educational institutions including tertiary, secondary and primary schools. Findings by SaharaReporters showed that the management of NNSHS didn’t stop academic activities in total disregard for the order. 

NNSHS-OFFA Students of the institution, who spoke with our correspondent, confirmed that there had not been a halt in academic activities since the directive from government in March. They accused the commandant of the institution, Captain (NN) AO Olowolagba, and other principal officers of not shutting down the institution due to their selfish interest. “The management of Nigeria Navy School of Health Sciences, Offa, has refused to close down despite government’s directives that all tertiary institutions should be shut down since March. “Though institutions that belong to our sister forces such as the army and air force have closed down but the commandant here refused to obey the directive due to his selfish interest. “Students’ welfare is not important to the Commanding Officer at all, this is a school where we don’t have water for days, the generator is not be powered efficiently. The food that is been cook for us is nothing to write home about. “The students are been charged anyhow, when I mean charged they use unknown laws against them. The only thing the Commandant known is embezzlement of funds because it was discovered that he is about to retire. “We hereby call on the appropriate authority like the DHQ, NHQ and the officers of the DMS and the FOC NAVTRAC to intervene.”
