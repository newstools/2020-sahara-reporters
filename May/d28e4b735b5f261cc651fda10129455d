A group, Concerned Nigerians, has attacked President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State over the arrest, detention and sentencing of a 70-year-old man, Bala Izala, and two others for allegedly insulting the duo. Theophilus Abu Agada, spokesperson for the group, in a statement described the action as shameful and an abuse of power by the President and Governor Masari. The statement reads, “We condemn the shameful act of impunity and abuse of office by President Buhari’s government and Katsina State governor, Aminu Masari, over the arrest, detention and sentencing of 70-year-old Bala Izala and two others for allegedly insulting’ the President and Governor Aminu Bello Masari. “Mr Izala had said he spoke out of anger when he visited his village and found out that bandits had killed his family members and rustled 15 of his cows. Though some kind-hearted Nigerians were able to pay the option of fine slammed on Mr Izala in securing his release, it is important to note that this is a gross abuse of power by the authorities.

"Even so, Mr Izala has the constitutional rights to criticise any elected official as guaranteed in section 39 of 1999 constitution which states that: “Every person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference”.
