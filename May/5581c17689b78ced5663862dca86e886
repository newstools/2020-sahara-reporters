The Nigeria Association of Women Journalists has expressed concern over the increase in the rate of rape cases in Bayelsa State, declaring that there have been three cases involving minors in Yenagoa, the state capital, in the last one week. In a statement by the Chairperson of the group, Maria Olodi-Osumah, and Secretary, Grace Amaegbe-Koinyan, NWAOJ said it was unfortunate and disturbing that such persons were subjected to inhumane acts. The statement reads, "We condemn these acts and call on government relevant agencies to take steps to stem the tide. â€œFor emphasis, NAWOJ will not hesitate to take appropriate actions against persons found wanting irrespective of political, religious affiliations, ethnic or social status. "While NAWOJ is aware of the numerous huddles in prosecuting perpetrators of crimes such as rape, parents, caregivers and guardians of children should take extra measures to monitor, protect their wards. "It is also important not to hesitate in reporting such to relevant authorities and agencies to ensure proper medical examination and support apart from preventing sexually transmitted diseases so the law can take its cause and ensure that justice is served."
