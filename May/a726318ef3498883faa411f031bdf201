Lt Commander Ajare Uchegbulah Amadi, a commandant of the Nigerian Navy abducted last week around the Oba Akoko area of Ondo State, has been rescued. Amadi was set free on Wednesday afternoon after his abductors abandoned him in a forest. The naval officer was seized while traveling to Abuja and his abductors had demanded the sum of N50m as ransom before releasing him. Spokesperson for the police in Ondo State, Tee-Leo Ikoro, confirmed the freedom of the naval officer to SaharaReporters on Wednesday. Ikoro said, “After realising that we are close on them and there was no place to hide any longer, they abandoned him in the forest and took to their heels.” See Also
