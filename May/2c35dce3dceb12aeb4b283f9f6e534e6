The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, and Enough is Enough Nigeria, have asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Comission to launch an investigation into corruption allegations against Lagos Assembly Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa. SaharaReporters in a series of reports had exposed how Obasa and some of his colleagues in the House of Assembly embezzle public funds without caution. Speaking with SaharaReporters on Tuesday, Adetokunbo Mumuni, Executive Director of SERAP, said the findings of such investigations must also be made known to the public.Â
