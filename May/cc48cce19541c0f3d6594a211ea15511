A former President of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), Malachy Ugwummadu, has called on the police to investigate reports of maltreatment of Nigerians working in Chinese companies in Ogun State. Ugwummadu described reports of forced labour as condemnable, adding that such acts violate all labour laws in the country and internationally. Speaking in an interview with SaharaReporters, Ugwummadu urged the victims of forced labour to seek justice.  He said: “It is regrettable that there are still such incidences of forced labour and abuse of work regulations and conventions. “Under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, no person shall be subjected to forced labour in any form that will amount to the abuse of their fundamental right to dignity of human person and liberty under section 34v and 35 as amended. “Under international conventions and labour law, it is not permissible to subject workers to any form of forced labour. The news that they are disallowed to leave the workplace immediately sent the message of forced labour that is not acceptable under international labour laws.

He added, “In the meantime, the Commissioner of Police in Ogun State must be immediately contacted to first of all secure the release of these people and investigate their claims. “If it turns out that foreign nationals now have the temerity not just to use our citizens as forced labourers, casual workers but now as slave workers, then those foreign national should be brought face-to-face with the law in a way that serves as a deterrent to others who may be willing to perpetrate such."
