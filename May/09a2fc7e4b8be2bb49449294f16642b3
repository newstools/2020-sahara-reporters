Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Colonel Hameed Ali (retd), on Saturday married a new wife at a low-key ceremony in Kano State. This came nearly two years after Aliâ€™s first wife, Hajiya Hadiza Jummai Ali, died in Abuja on October 29, 2018. Their marriage is blessed with four children. Before being appointed as Comptroller General of NCS by President Muhammadu Buhari, Ali had previously served as military administrator of Kaduna State from 1996 to 1998.
