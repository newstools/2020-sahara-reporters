The HeartBeat Professionals Association, a social-political group based in Edo State, has faulted calls by the United States Government for a fresh probe of the tenure of President of African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina. Despite being cleared of allegations of misconduct and corrupt practices by the AfDB board, the US and other Western stakeholders are insisting on an independent probe of Adesina, who is the sole candidate for the bank’s topmost position for another five years. According to the group, the move by the United States was aimed at distracting Africa’s agricultural sector projections. In a statement by its Secretary-General, Osagie Otokhagua, the group said the allegation was coming at a time when the African Development Bank was strategising on how African countries can process and utilise agricultural products to their benefit. The statement reads, “We commend the Chairman, Board of Governors of AfDB for exonerating Adesina from the allegation. “We appreciate the various African leaders who stood their ground against the attempt to undermine AfDB and its long earned reputation. “At this critical time, we call on Africa to remain focused and support the bank and its President in the progressive post-COVID-19 recovery and sustainable agricultural development. “The bank is a pride to all Africans and should not be undermined or distracted by any entity.” The Nigerian Government including other prominent citizens like ex-President, Olusegun Obasanjo, have all expressed support for Adesina despite the push by US for a fresh investigation on his tenure at the financial institution.
