The Northern Governors Forum has asked for special fund from the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to combat the spread of COVID-19 in the region. President Buhari had approved N10bn for Lagos. In a communique issued after the Northern Governors Forum held a teleconference on Wednesday, the governors said their states have 54 per cent of the total COVID-19 cases recorded in the country and appealed for special relief.
