The Indigenous People of Biafra has told President Muhammadu Buhari to allow Igbo call for a peaceful referendum to determine their fate in Nigeria. IPOB lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, disclosed this on Saturday while speaking with SaharaReporters on the struggle and agitation for Biafra. He said it was obvious that the Eastern region had been relegated to the background and no longer part of Nigeria and the only option left was peaceful settlement of their grievances through a referendum.

Ejiofor said, "They believe that Igbo are not part of the system and the best thing for them to do is for the government to allow Igbo to call for referendum. It is a process that is constitutionally backed by international conventions and laws. "We are no longer part and parcel of the system and it is high time for us to think home. Let us have our own house with unbiased process which is what Nnamdi Kanu advocated for." He blamed the Nigerian Government for failing to tender an apology that would have helped heal the wounds caused by the Civil War where Igbo were killed in large numbers. He said, "Government owe our people apology. Government has not assuaged the feelings of the Igbo in the manner in which they were killed and slaughtered. "It is a matter of common knowledge that between 1967- 1970 we experienced mass murder (genocide) against Igbo which has continued unabated with the way our people are being treated." Ejiofor said the struggle would soon come to fruition now that Nnamdi Kanu had explored all diplomatic contacts to ensure a peaceful actualisation of the project.He stated that, "Biafra will be realised peacefully not violently and he (Nnamdi Kanu) has been matching toward that fact. He is not there for any political purpose. He is only motivated in the cause he believes in."It is glaring that we are not part of this system."
