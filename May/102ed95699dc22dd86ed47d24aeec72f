The military in Niger Republic has killed 74 Boko Haram Insurgents in an operation at Liwur, an area near Lake Chad. Boko Haram terrorists have killed at least 36,000 people including hundreds in the Diffa area, which led to the offensive. The Niger Defence Ministry in a statement on Wednesday said 25 terrorists were killed South of Diffa, the main city in South-East Niger, while about 50 were neutralised on the same day on Nigerian soil in the Lake Chad region in two operations, AFP reports. On Monday, troops from Niger's contingent in the regional force carried out "aggressive reconnaissance" on the banks of the Komadougou River and clashed with Boko Haram fighters at a locality 74km (45 miles) South of Diffa, the defence ministry said. The Niger military said it seized a vehicle and two motorcycles, as well as arms and ammunition and other material for military use from the terrorists.
