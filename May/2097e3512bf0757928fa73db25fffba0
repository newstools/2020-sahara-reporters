SaharaReporters learnt that the almajiris got into Ondo by hiding inside a trailer carrying cement into the state. A man suspected to have been leading the almajiris, Mr Umar Garuba, said the sum of N15,000 was paid to the driver, who brought them to Akure, the state capital. He said about 25 of the almajiri were being transported to Ondo town before were caught. "I was going to keep them (the almajiris) in Ondo town to settle down there while I travelled back to Sokoto when they caught us here," he said. Mr Jimoh Dojumo, Special Assistant to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Security Matters, while speaking with journalists on the development, decried the influx of the almajiris into the state from the North. He said, "We don’t even know if this is their final destination anyway but the fact remains that we have been able to check them here and we are returning them back. "Mr governor directed that they should be returned to where they were coming from.”
