The Adamawa State Government has repatriated over 400 almajiris to Gombe and other states in the Northern Nigeria. The Secretary to the State Government, Bashiru Ahmad, said the move was in line with the agreement reached at several meetings of the Northern Governors’ Forum. The SSG, who supervised the repatriation in Yola, the state capital on Wednesday, said the governors in the region have agreed to repatriate the almajiris as part of the measures to contain the spread of Coronavirus. He said, "The decision to take almajiris back to their states of origin was taken by the Northern Governors' Forum at their various meetings and it predates the coming of COVID-19. "But with the coming of Coronavirus, it became imperative that states should act fast because it was one of the potent vehicles of distributing the virus if care is not taken. “The manner these children are accommodated and mingle amongst people in the markets and within our communities poses high risk, and that is why the governors decided that this was the right time to do this.”
