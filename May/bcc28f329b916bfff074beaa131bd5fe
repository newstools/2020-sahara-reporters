Makana Enan Nagari, a councillor representing Vulpi ward in Numan Local Government Council, has been declared wanted for allegedly rustling cows. Humwashi Wonosikou, Press Secretary to the state governor, made this known in Yola on Wednesday. He said, “The action is coming at a time government has succeeded at stabilising the area after the incessant attacks on villages along the borders of Adamawa and Taraba. “Government is appealing to both headers and farmers not to take the law into their hands, but allow the law to take its course as government is doing everything possible to ensure that peace prevails between farmers and herders and all law-abiding citizens. “A responsible government will not sit back and watch criminals destroy the hard-earned peace it has been able to achieve. “His Excellency is appealing to residents of the state to help the government towards building a just and egalitarian society where peace and tranquillity exists."
