He said, “They are holding innocent people because IPOB does not have a camp in Delta State nor any of its members in possession of AK-47.“I don’t condole any crime and criminality in IPOB. The AK47 are not our own. They are what the Fulani herdsmen are carrying about.“We are none violence organisation seeking for freedom legitimately.
