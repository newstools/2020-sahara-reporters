The Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs has warned Muslim faithful in Nigeria, who have insisted on observing Eid prayers in groups, to think twice and not jeopardise the achievements recorded by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control on curbing the spread of Coronavirus in the country. Many state governors lifted the ban placed on religious gatherings as a measure to contain the spread of COVID-19. Religious organisations had mounted pressure on the federal and state governments to open worship centres. The Head of Media and Communication, NSCIA, Aselemi Ibrahim, in a chat with SaharaReporters on Friday in Abuja said people needed to be alive to worship God and that there was no need to congregate for Eid prayers.


Google He said, "The council can only appeal that COVIF-19 threat is real and you need to be alive to worship God." He urged those, who want to socialise and visit friends during Salah to ensure wearing face mask and use hand sanitiser as part of precautionary measures. Meanwhile, Minister of Federal Capital Territory, Muhammed Bello, has directed Muslim faithful to observe Eid prayers at home. In a statement on Friday by the Chief Press Secretary to the minister, Anthony Ogunleye, Bello called for support and understanding from all residents. He added that efforts were being made to curtail and eventually end the spread of COVID-19 in the nation's capital.
