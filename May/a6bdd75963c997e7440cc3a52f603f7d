SMBLF said, "God who was kind to us, we were not prepared to confront a health challenge at the level of Coronavirus that was taking down prime ministers and kings around the world. "It is time to recalibrate as only those who have serious challenges would now think we can return to the careless and reckless lives we were living in the past." The group asserted that the leadership of the country can't afford to go back to the old order of central planning that kills local initiatives. The group appealed to all Nigerians to take safety as a personal priority as the lockdown is eased.
