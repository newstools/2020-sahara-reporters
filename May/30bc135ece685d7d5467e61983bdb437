"That Eid-el-Fitr prayer be observed at home with family members or alone in case there isn’t anyone with him or her at home. "However, in states where governments have reached concrete decisions to observe the ‘Eid-el-Fitr prayer, based on their medical experts advice, strictest measures of distancing, face masks and sanitizers be taken to protect worshipers.
