Auwal El-Kabir, a Nigerian lawyer, who was among those that petitioned the Nigeria Police Force to arrest activist and atheist, Mubarak Bala, has launched a page on Facebook to target atheists and expose them to danger. Bala was arrested by the police for allegedly insulting Prophet Muhammad after he made a post on Facebook. A growing number of atheists in Northern Nigeria have been using Facebook to debate and express themselves and their beliefs. The new anti-atheist platform on Facebook created on May 10, has already garnered 1,500 followers at the time of filing this report. Posts by members of the group taunt atheists and asks them to respond to existential questions with the sole aim of identifying and exposing them to danger.    The group describes itself as "an Islamic movement targeted against the rise of atheism in Northern Nigeria" and frowns at "blasphemy" See Also
