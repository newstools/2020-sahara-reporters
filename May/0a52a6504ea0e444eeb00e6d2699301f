The United States Embassy in Nigeria has said that a further $319m – N121bn – of late General Sani Abacha loot was in France and the United Kingdom. The embassy in a statement said that $167m in stolen assets is split between France and the UK while another $152m was in Britain. The release of the $152m is being argued in court however. The statement said, “The funds returned last week are distinct and separate from an additional $167m in stolen assets also forfeited in the United Kingdom and France, as well as $152m still in active litigation in the United Kingdom.” The litigation is over a 2003 agreement reached between Kebbi State governor, Atiku Bagudu, and the Nigerian Government. According to the deal, $100m of the $152m will come to Bagudu.
