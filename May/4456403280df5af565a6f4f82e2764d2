Google Prof Aminu Mohammed, former Chairman, Nigeria Medical Association, Kano branch, who confirmed the incident, said the health workers were in the PPEs when they were taken and locked in one of the rooms at the centre. Mohammed decried the maltreatment of the health workers by the patients, saying they had to break open the door of the room where they were kept when the heat became unbearable. According to one of the patients, they have been in isolation for one week without been subjected to medical examination to truly determine if they had contracted the virus or not, saying they wanted to be released to rejoin their families.
