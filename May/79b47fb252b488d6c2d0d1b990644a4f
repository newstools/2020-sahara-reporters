Former Abia State governor, Orji Uzor Kalu, whose conviction was nullified by the Supreme Court on Friday, has said that he can’t wait to rejoin his colleagues in the Senate after spending the last five months in prison. The Supreme Court had on Friday upturned his conviction for alleged fraud and ordered a retrial. Justice Mohammed Idris had in December 2019 sentenced the ex-governor to 12 years imprisonment for the fraud he allegedly perpetrated during his tenure as Abia State governor. But in a unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court led by Justice Olabode Rhodes-Vivour on Friday, the apex court nullified the entire trial on the grounds that the constitution does not permit a judge elevated to a higher court to return to a lower court to conclude a part-heard case. In a statement, the former Abia State governor said his stay in prison had taught him invaluable lessons about the country’s justice system.
