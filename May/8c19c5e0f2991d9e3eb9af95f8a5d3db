Ten more persons have tested positive for COVID-19 in Bauchi State. Chairman, Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Rilwan Mohammed, on Saturday said the new cases included six more almajiri deportees from Kano State. The Kano State Government had sent many almajiris back to their home states including Bauchi as part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. He said, “We recorded 10 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Bauchi State. The results were sent to me from the National Research Veterinary Institute, Vom, Plateau State at about 11pm Friday. “This brings the total number of confirmed cases in the state to 48 with 42 of them active while six have already been discharged after they tested negative. All our cases are returnees except our index case.
