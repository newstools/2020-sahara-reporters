A former governorship candidate under the Peoples Democratic Party platform in Osun State, Ademola Adeleke, has been discharged by the Federal High Court in Abuja after being charged with exam malpractice. Adeleke, who is a former member of Nigeria’s Senate, was discharged on Friday following a ruling by Justice Inyang Ekwo. Simon Lough, the prosecuting counsel, informed the court that they concluded on removing Adeleke from the case since he was not in Nigeria at the moment and had not been attending court sittings on the matter. The charges were amended by the prosecution, which went on to arraign in court on Friday four others said to have helped Adeleke perpetrate exam fraud. Dr Alex Izinyon (SAN), the defence lawyer, agreed to the removal of Adeleke’s name from the case, urging the court to grant a consequential order showing that the former senator was discharged and acquitted.
