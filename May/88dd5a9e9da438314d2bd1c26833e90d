A group, Young Citizens of Nigeria, has asked the Imo State Government to reexamine the basis for the indefinite suspension of journalist, Vivian Ottih.This was contained in a statement by its Director of Media and Publicity, Augustine Nwaobi, which was signed by Chairman, Comrade Ekene Okonkwo.In the statement, YCN advised the administration of Governor Hope Uzodinma to thread cautiously on issues of public importance, adding that the suspension of the chairperson of Nigeria Association of Women Journalists over the request for the payment of three months salaries was totally bad for the image of the state. Recall that the Imo Government had suspended Mrs Ottih indefinitely for using Facebook to request for her salary after an official report claimed that her action was an “embarrassment” to the government.

He should know that a matter that affects a journalist anywhere in the world is of global concern, hence the need to manage it with wisdom, and not the recalcitrant haste that greeted the Ottih's demand."Before the issue begins generating negative reactions worldwide, we urge Imo governor to do the needful by cancelling the indefinite suspension previously slammed on Vivian Ottih. The governor should understand that as a senior editor,  the chairperson was instinctively mandated to speak for NAWOJ and shouldn't be punished for being a good leader."
