The Kwara State Police Command has said it has launched an investigation to the renewed cult clashes in the state. The investigation was launched after a recent clash led to the death of two persons at the state capital. Residents of Ilorin Metropolis, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said different cult members now engage in street fight.  In an interview with SaharaReporters, the Public Relations Officer of the Kwara State Police Command, DSP Okasanmi Ajayi, said the police are investigating the reports of cult clashes. He said all units had been activated to maintain law and order in the state. “There was an incident where somebody was killed by a suspected cult group and the family, ignoring the police, went to bury the corpse. We were able to get that and we believe so much that there could be a reprisal. “The Commissioner of Police, Kayode Egbetokun has put all Divisional Police Officers on notice to ensure that nothing as such happens. “Ever since then, we have heard rumours that there was an attack but no official report was made until yesterday that we heard that one person was shot. “The police are investigating that and I can assure you that the command is on top of the situation.” The residents of Ilorin Metropolis, however, expressed lack of confidence in the investigation being carried out by the police. "They have been killing since last week and the police usually say they will investigate with nothing to show as the outcome of the investigation," a resident of Ilorin said.
