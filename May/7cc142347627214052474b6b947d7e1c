The Lagos State Government is projecting that the Coronavirus pandemic may explode to 120,000 cases across the state by July or August. Commissioner for Health in the state, Prof Akin Abayomi, made this known on Friday. He said that the state may possibly record between 90,000 and 120,000 cases of the virus within the period. The commissioner said with the current trend the COVID-19 cases in Lagos was expected to reach its peak by that period. Abayomi stated that Lagos had expanded its testing capacity to reach large numbers of people in a bid to flatten the curve. He attributed the sharp rise in cases being recorded to the decentralisation of sample collection across the 20 local government areas of the state. According to him, if the government had not been proactive, Lagos would have by now recorded 6,000 cases rather than the 1,491 cases recorded so far. Lagos State currently has 1,491 confirmed Coronavirus cases.
