Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, has described striking doctors in the state as irresponsible for requesting for wage increase. Resident doctors at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Ogun State, had on May 22 announced a strike action over the way the state government had been handling the welfare of doctors. But in a trending video, Governor Dapo Abiodun chastised the medical practitioners, saying they should be more concerned about people’s welfare than clamouring for money. He said, “I find it difficult to believe that when we are all putting our thinking caps on, trying to figure out what to do and how to do it, any set of people will be irresponsibly requesting for a wage increase. And these set of people are people that we have entrusted our health to at a point like this. I am very disappointed, I think, that is what I will say for now. “I am beginning to wonder and it is being speculated that this may actually have political inclinations, these people may be politically sponsored. I am yet to believe it but at this point in time, anything is believable. If you see people who are educated, people who went to medical school, people who graduated, whose charge is to look after people, that is what they are charged for; that is what should be paramount to them not money, and we have done our best. “I authorised the use of PPE to them, face mask and everything. I increased their hazard allowance by 300 per cent.”
