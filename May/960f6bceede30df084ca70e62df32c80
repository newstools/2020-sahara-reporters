Commissioner of Police in Ondo State has called on officers manning entry points to prevent anyone from sneaking into the state. Adie said he had been receiving reports that many of the vehicles and trucks used in transporting essential commodities were being used to smuggle passengers into the state. This, according to him, was also putting the state and residents at risk of contracting Coronavirus. 

Ondo Police Commissioner Adie Recall that there had been growing concerns on the influx of "almajiris" from North into Ondo State recently. Speaking on the issue, Adie said, “To continue to see or hear of inter-state passenger transport vehicles into Ondo State while we (police) man all entry-points into the state puts us in bad light. "With the effect of COVID-19 on all human endeavours, our duty to save life at this time is sacrosanct and can only be achieved when it is done with humane touch and affection. "I will therefore warn that men in all border posts must be extremely and judiciously vigilant never to allow anybody or vehicle without the authorization of government entry into the state. "I have directed that all trucks conveying foodstuffs and essential commodities be properly checked as some of them now hide some restive passengers along with the goods they carry." Adie tasked the officers to display more professionalism mostly during this period of Coronavirus and lockdown in the country.
