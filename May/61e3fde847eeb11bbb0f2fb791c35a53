Former Liaison Officer to President Shehu Shagari, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, says the northern youths flooding the South are not Almajiri. Yakassai, who tried to set the records straight regarding the influx of northern youths to the South, insisted the youths were not Almajirai while calling for an investigation. Tanko-Yakasai “You need to investigate those who are sending these Almajirai. Is it true that they are Almajirai?: “I saw a bunch of youths wearing shirts; the Almajirai don’t wear shirts. In the beginning, they said Fulani and now they changed to Almajirai,” Yakassai said in an interview with Vanguard. He added, “They wear the same things most of our compatriots wear. These are not the Almajirai from where I come from. “This is part of the kill-and-hate Nigeria campaign and I will not be part of it. I am a committed Nigerian; I spent all my life, starting from 1953 when I was just 28 years old, to fight for the unity of Nigeria. I will not support or associate myself with anybody who is anti-Nigeria.”
