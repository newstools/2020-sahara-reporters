A group, Ohanaeze Youth Council, has called on governors of South-Eastern states in Nigeria to deport all almajiris in their territory. In a statement signed by President-General of the organisation, Okechukwu Isigusoro, and Secretary-General, Nnabuike Okwu, the group said that the interception of children from Kano by the Enugu COVID-19 Task Force should be investigated as well. The statement reads, “We, the Ohanaeze Youth Council, describes the interception of Kano almajiris at Enugu border by Enugu State COVID-19 Task Force as collaborative rogue operations and nefarious activities of Northern elders to export Coronavirus almajiris index cases to the South-East. “The Ohanaeze Youth Council appeal to the South-East governors to review the circumstances surrounding the decisions of Northern governors on the ban of almajiris from anywhere they are found back to their states of origin and take a decision to ensure that all almajiris on the streets of South-East are sent back in line with the established precedent of Northern governors.”
