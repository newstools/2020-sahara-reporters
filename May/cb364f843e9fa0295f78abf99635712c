The abolition of the almajiri system by Northern Governors Forum is not a good decision, the Senator representing Kano South, Kabiru Gaya, has said. Gaya, who recalled that he was once an almajiri, said moving the almajiris from one state to the other has only worsened the COVID-19 crisis and heaped more burden on the parents of such children, who are already overwhelmed by poverty. The senator spoke in an interview with Channels Television on Monday monitored by SaharaReporters. He said, “Scrapping the almajiri system won’t solve our problems. We have to think of a way to educate them. I was an almajiri. When I was in primary school, I came back in the evening to the almajiri School. And we are contributing our best to the country as a former almajiri today. “Packing those children to homes where their parents cannot feed them will only expose them to crime. The governors should put heads together. You don’t make a law and do not provide an alternative. Instead of transporting them back to their states, the government should create more schools where the children can go and get a better form of education and enjoy the Quaranic education as well.
