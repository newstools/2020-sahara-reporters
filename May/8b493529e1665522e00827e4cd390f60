All COVID-19 patients in Taraba State have been discharged after testing negative, SaharaReporters gathered. The state governor, Darius Ishaku, disclosed this in Jalingo, the state capital, on Friday while inspecting a 100 bed isolation center. He said, "At the moment, all positive COVID-19 patients have been declared negative except for the 88 almajris, whose result are being expected." The governor decried lack of ventilators and testing kits in the state but assured residents of his commitments to establish three testing centers.
