Muazu Magaji, former Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure in Kano State, has tested positive for COVID-19. Governor of the state, Abdullahi Ganduje, had on April 18 sacked Magaji as a result of his unguarded utterances over the demise of Abba Kyari, the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari. The commissioner, who took a swipe at the deceased in a series of Facebook post, had previously wished the late Kyari not to return as Chief of Staff to the President after testing positive for COVID-19 a few weeks ago. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Magaji said, “Dear all, I do truly apologize to you not getting across to me on phone or messages. I have been indispose due to ongoing health challenges some of us going through in Kano. In Sha Allah it will be well. “This morning my NCDC test is out. I have been confirmed COVID-19 positive and have been moved to one of the state facilities... pray for us.” See Also
