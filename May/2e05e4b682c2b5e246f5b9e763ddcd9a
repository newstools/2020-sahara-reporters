An 82-year-old widow, who is also suffering from hypertension, has recovered from Coronavirus disease after receiving a nine-day treatment at the Isolation and Treatment Centre, Asubiaro, Osogbo, Osun State. She was confirmed positive and admitted at the isolation centre on May 13, 2020. Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr Rafiu Isamotu, disclosed this in a statement in Osogbo. Isamotu said the woman’s recovery from the virus beats the odds as elderly people with chronic diseases were the highest risk group as many in that category are unable to recover from COVID-19. The statement reads, "The story of the 82-year-old widow who recovered from the dreaded Coronavirus provides a glimmer of hope, considering that she is a hypertensive patient on medication. Although when she arrived at our isolation centre on May 13, she had no cough, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, fever or anosmia associated with the virus except for diarrhoea and we successfully treated her for it and she was stable all through the period of hospitalisation. "On her 9th day on admission, we carried out a follow-up Polymerase Chain Reaction test on her and the result came back negative and she was subsequently discharged on May 24, 2020. "Furthermore, a follow-up at her home after her discharge revealed that she was stable.”
