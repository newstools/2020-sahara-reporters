According to a source, the three might have contracted the virus during the funeral of Sheriff's late father, Galadima Modu Sheriff.

"Prominent people called him to express their disappointment in him. “So he was forced to invite NCDC officials and they came to test him on May 8. So also were members of his family and all his staff. “The result all came negative except that of two policemen attached to him and their driver who tested positive for the virus,” the source said.  The source added the trio have been moved to an isolation centre in Abuja.
