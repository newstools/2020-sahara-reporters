Aggrieved workers of the National Institute for Education Planning Administration in Ondo State have warned against the appointment of an ‘outsider’ as substantive Director-General of the institute without following due process. The workers, under the aegis of the Joint Research and Allied Institutions Sector Unions, gave the warning in a petition dated May 15, 2020 and written to the Minister of Education, Mr Adamu Adamu. In the petition obtained by SaharaReporters, the group alleged that the name of an "authorised person" was being recommended to the Minister of Education for the post of DG without the consent of the institute's Governing Council. 

Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu The trio of Mr Bibitayo Ajise, Mr Ganiyu Toyin and Mr Solomon Ogudo, who lead organised labour unions in the institute, said only the governing council had the statutory role to make such recommendation. The petition reads in part, "In view of this information, the three unions of the institute (NIEPA) strongly condemn such unauthorised recommendation of an outsider for this (DG) position without the knowledge of the Governing Council that has such mandate. "Based on the breach of due process, the unions unequivocally condemn the flouting of protocol and hereby make a compassionate appeal that such unwarranted recommendation that was not known by the council should be discarded. "The unions wish to reiterate their decision that they will vehemently reject any such kangaroo appointment." A source at the Ministry of Education, who spoke with SaharaReporters, confirmed the receipt of the petition, noting that the issue was already being looked into. He also added that the minister had waded into the matter and will be having a meeting with the Governing Council of the institute soon.
