The Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has restrained the Minister of Petroleum Resources from revoking the Ororo Marginal Field in OML 95 pending the determination of the substantive suit. Justice Muslim Sule Hassan granted the order of interim injunction against the Petroleum Ministry and Department of Petroleum Resources, who was also joined in the motion ex parte filed by Owena Oil and Gas Ltd. The judge ordered the parties to maintain status quo in relation to the revocation pending the determination of the Motion on Notice and adjourned till June 10 for hearing. Owena, in suit FHC/L/CS/587/2020 filed through its counsel Kemi Pinheiro, SAN, said the 1st and 2nd respondents "purportedly revoked the Ororo Maginal Field without recourse to the Plaintiff”, adding that it would suffer "irreparable damage unless the defendants are restrained". It sought an interim injunction restraining the first two respondents from implementing, continuing to implement, enforcing and/or giving effect to the purported revocation of the Ororo Marginal Field within OML 95. The suit reads, "An order restraining both respondents from publishing the purported revocation of the Ororo Marginal Field within OML 95 in the official gazette of the Federal Republic of Nigeria pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice." Giving his ruling, the judge said, “Interim injunction of status quo is hereby granted retraining the defendants/respondents from taking any step in respect of the revocation of the Ororo Marginal Field in OML 95 pending the determination of the motion on notice." The Ororo field, discovered in 1986, is located within OML 95 in shallow waters offshore Ondo State – it lies in water depths ranging between 23ft and 27 ft.
