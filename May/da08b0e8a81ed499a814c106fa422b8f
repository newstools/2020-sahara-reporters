The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has placed the mother of late Super Eagles striker, Rashidi Yekini, Alhaja Sikiratu, on a monthly stipend of N10,000. This was disclosed on Wednesday by Olaitan Shittu, a representative of the Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, during a visit to Alhaja Yekini in Ijagbo, Kwara State.

Late Rashidi Yekini Shittu also donated N50,000 as part of the Ramadan gifts to the septuagenarian on behalf of the minister. Also donated with the cash is a 50kg bag of rice, 10kg bag of wheat and six tins of Milo beverage drink. Shittu said that the ministry would also be extending the same gesture to the mother of late Super Eagles player, Samuel Okwaraji. Alhaja Yekini, who spoke in her local dialect (Yoruba), thanked the minister for the kind gesture. She said, “I was hospitalised for few days some months ago and I did cater for myself despite scarce resources. “I need help from Nigerians, but this minister has done very well, especially remembering me in this holy month of Ramadan. “Since my son died, it has been very tough for me because I do not have any help from people. “Rashidi’s siblings are not doing well too, so, I was left to struggle for life every day.” The late Yekini died in 2012 at the age of 48 after retiring from football.
