Armed bandits have attacked Daudawa and Angwan Baki communties in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State. The bandits, according to a resident in the state, Mahadi Danbinta Guga, killed two persons while kidnapping five others on Tuesday evening. The attacks comes at a time residents of the state are taking to various social media platforms to call for prayers over the rising spate of killings and terror in Katsina. Recall that on May 6, a 72-year-old man, Lawal Izala was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment by a Katsina Court after he appeared in a viral video allegedly insulting President Buhari. SaharaReportersÂ later found out that Izala was angry after his village got sacked by bandits who killed his cows and some relatives while he was away. Terrorist, bandits and ethno-religious killings persist in Nigeria's North-East and North-West despite promises by government to tackle the situation.
