Nigerians stuck in different parts of India have called on the Nigerian Government to facilitate their return to the country. They appealed as government continues its plan of evacuating Nigerians from different parts of the world. Speaking in an interview with Channels TV monitored by SaharaReporters, Esther, one of those stranded in Bangalore, disclosed that many Nigerians had been stuck in India for about two months even though their flight was already booked to depart for Nigeria. She said, “Our flight was delayed, four times already. We’ve been here for almost two months, we are just waiting. We got here in March and there is no certainty whether or not they will still delay the flight. “The High Commissioner of Nigeria in India has reached out to us; he created a Whatsapp group that has 200 Nigerians as at now and he’s trying to arrange for us to get a flight that will take us from one of the two ports in India to Nigeria as soon as possible but of course there are certain limitations and restrictions that he is trying to handle it at this point.” She lamented that many of those stranded were being forced to use their flight fares for accommodation and feeding. “There are many of us, even students, who are here for medical reasons and business. It’s becoming something else because you have to pay for accommodation, feeding and other costs. The possibility of that being taken into consideration is slim and it’s not easy for Nigerians right now.”
