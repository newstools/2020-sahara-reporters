Kaduna State governor, Nasir el-Rufai, has said that National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and a former governor of Lagos, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, was not his man. El-Rufai made the remarks during a webinar to commemorate the 63rd birthday of Minister of Interior and former Osun State governor, Rauf Aregbesola, on Saturday. It is believed that both el-Rufai and Tinubu nurse the ambition of taking over from President Muhammadu Buhari when he leaves office in 2023. El-Rufai said, “I want to congratulate my brother, Ogbeni (Aregbesola), on his birthday. You know I’m your man any day. I’m not Asiwaju’s man and you are Asiwaju’s man, but I am your man any day. Asiwaju and I have differences but you and I have no differences.” Tinubu has been silent in recent times, raising speculations that he may have been sidelined by the Buhari administration, thereby reducing his influence on national politics.
