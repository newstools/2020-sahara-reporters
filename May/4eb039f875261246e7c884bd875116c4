The Nigerian Government has asked state and privately run schools to begin taking measures that will see children return to the classroom. Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, gave the directive during Wednesday’s briefing with journalists in Abuja to give update on the fight against the virus. He said, “I wish to inform Nigerians that the Federal Ministry of Education will roll out measures for the reopening of schools. 

Students “The Presidential Task Force wishes to use the occasion of this celebration to congratulate our children and assure them, their parents and all stakeholders alike that all hands are on deck to reopen schools at a safe time. “We therefore use this medium to urge states, local governments, proprietors and all other stakeholders to begin to take steps that will facilitate an early and safe reopening.” Schools have been locked up across Nigeria since March as part of measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the country.
