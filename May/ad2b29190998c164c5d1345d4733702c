Doctors at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in Ogun State have resolved not to work on weekends. This is following a break down in negotiations between the aggrieved medical workers and state government. The medical personnel under the platform of Association of Resident Doctors in OOUTH said their colleagues in isolation centres across the state were exempted from the industrial action. The group said, “Since government has chosen to simply rub the issues without any form of real commitment to begin to treat us fairly, we have resolved to discharge our duties only during working days of the week because of our concern for the people during  these trying times. We have decided to stay at home on weekends. “We hope the state government will wake up to its responsibility and our congress shall review in two weeks if any worthwhile transformation occurs. “We have decided to leave our members working directly in the COVID-19 treatment centres to go on with their duties uninterrupted within this additional two-week wait, after which we will reappraise and determine what next.”
