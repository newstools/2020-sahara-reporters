Over 60 people were killed on Wednesday night when some gunmen attacked Garki, Katuma and Kuzari villages under Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State. Those, who sustained life-threatening injuries, are currently receiving treatment at General Hospital, Sabon Birni, according to residents, who spoke with SaharaReporters. The number of people that died may rise as more corpses are being deposited at the mortuary of Sabon Birni General Hospital, it was discovered.   Frequent attacks by gunmen across the local government area has forced hundreds of people to flee their villages. On Monday, 18 people were killed in another attack at Faji, Lanjegu, Kadaye, Marakawa and Garin Ahmadu villages -- about 15 to 20 kilometres from Sabon Birni town. Some residents of the affected villages alleged that some of the armed attackers were herders, who used the occasion as their response to farmers' efforts to prevent them from destroying their farms by grazing their heard. Since the beginning of this year, a growing number of residents in Sabon Birni LGA have fled their homes while those, who had stayed back, had formed vigilante groups to protect their communities.
