Liberia is set to excuse religious centres from the lockdown in the country. President George Weah announced that he would partially allow churches and mosques to hold prayer programmes, as lockdown will be extended in other parts of the country. In a statement, the former footballer said emergency measures to curb the virus would be extended for two weeks but churches and mosques would be open with guidelines put in place for their programmes.
