A driver at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Akure, Ondo State, has tested positive for Coronavirus. A source at IDH disclosed to our correspondent that the driver was showing symptoms of the virus few days ago before his sample was later collected for test. It was gathered that the driver always carried blood samples and patients for the IDH since the outbreak of Coronavirus in the state. Two casual workers attending to patients at the same hospital also tested positive for the virus. All three persons have since been isolated at the same facility in Akure. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu described the driver and the two casual workers as "heros", adding that the state was ready to compensate them for their efforts when they recover from the virus. He said, "Both the driver who carries samples to test centres outside the state and the two casual workers in the wards took the highest risk in helping their fellow human beings. They are our heroes. "I want their families and loved ones to know that Ondo State Government stands firmly with them and will walk with them through these difficult times until they recover and fully get back their daily lives. "To further demonstrate our understanding and total commitment to supporting the frontline risk bearers, I have directed immediate absorption into the public service of the infected casual workers at the IDH. "I have also approved that all health workers in the state be paid 50 per cent of their consolidated basic salary as hazard allowance."
