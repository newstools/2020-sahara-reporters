President of Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, Jonathan Asake, has said that over 30 dead bodies of victims of the attacks by armed bandits in Kajuru under Southern Kaduna were decomposing in the bush. He said security agents had not gone to the affected communities to retrieve the bodies, adding that over 60 people were still missing after the attacks. He disclosed this at the weekend in Rimau village where many displaced victims were taking refuge at a primary school. He faulted claims by the police that the attacks only took place in two communities (Ungwar Rana and Gonarogo) on May 12 and 13.
