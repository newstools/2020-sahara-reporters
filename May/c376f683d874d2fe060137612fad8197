The Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency has said that it spends a cumulative of N4,500 to feed COVID-19 patients per day in the state in order to quell agitations. Dr Rilwanu Mohammed, Executive Chairman of the agency, made the disclosure while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria on Sunday. Bauchi State has so far 232 confirmed cases of COVID-19; 164 had been discharged, five deaths and 63 active cases. He said, “It was the state governor that ordered us that we should put N1,500 per single meal in a day. “That is, N1,500 meal during breakfast, the same amount for lunch as well as dinner because he doesn’t want anybody in isolation to suffer or complain so that we won’t have any riot like in some other states. “This brings the total amount of money on meal per day to N4,500 on a single patient."
