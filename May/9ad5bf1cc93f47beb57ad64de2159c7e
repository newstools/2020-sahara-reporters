Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria otherwise known as Shiites, have raised the alarm of an alleged plan by government to stage a riot in Kaduna Correctional Center in order to indict the group. In a statement on Tuesday by the Secretary of Academic Forum of the movement, Abdullahi Muhammad Musa, IMN said the plan was to engage some faceless groups to stage a violent protest in Kaduna and FCT centres of the facility where their members were being detained. The statement added that the plan was aimed at eliminating their leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, who has been in detention since December 2015 alongside his wife, Zeenat. The statement reads, "In the most recent cunning stratagem, a deleterious “intelligence report” is being circulated to the Nigerian security agents that a group termed “JAISH IMAN AHMAD” is going through a “gradual transformation...into an organised militia group” and nothing could be farther from the truth. "Our concern heightened the more the moment we saw in the mischievous report that “members” of the so-called group are to “attack key targets nationwide – correctional facilities in Kaduna, FCT and the National Assembly Complex.” The group maintained that the purported intelligence report emanated from Force Intelligence Bureau, a unit of the Nigeria Police Force and therefore called on Nigerians to disregard it.
