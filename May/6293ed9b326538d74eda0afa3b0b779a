The Nigeria Air Force has announced that six of its personnel working as aides to late ex-Chief of Defence Staff, Alex Badeh, have been imprisoned by a Special Court-Martial sitting in Abuja as a result of his killing in December 2018 by gunmen along Abuja-Keffi Road while on his way back from his farm. A statement by Director of Public Relations and Information of the Nigeria Air Force, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, on Saturday morning, said those sent to jail were imprisoned for absconding while Badeh was being attacked.Â
