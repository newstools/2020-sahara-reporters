In yet another grand corruption, SaharaReporters has uncovered how Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, illegally collected N45,750,00 for a Christmas party that never held. The money, which was approved on November 22, 2019 by Obasa for one of his mistresses, who doubles as the officer to organise the Christmas party for children of lawmakers, ran contrary to the annual Christmas party organised by the Lagos State Government. SaharaReporters gathered that despite the party not taking place, the money approved and released for it by Obasa was never accounted for. 

Mudashiru Obasa “We were all looking forward to the party after we heard over N45m was released but our hope was dashed in December when we were told no Christmas party again. “On hearing this, almost all the Assembly staff cursed both the Speaker and his mistress for such callous depletion of our common patrimony without any service from the fund,” a staff told SaharaReporters. Recall that SaharaReporters had published how Obasa tricked former governor of the state, Akinwunmi Ambode, to collect the sum of N350m to organise a conference for lawmakers from across the country.
