Many people, who tested positive for Coronavirus in Lagos State are on the run from being taken to isolation centres for treatment. Akin Abayomi, Commissioner for Health in the state, made this known on Friday at the state secretariat. Abayomi said this was one of the reasons the state still had unoccupied beds at the isolation centres despite recording more cases than its bed-capacity. He said, “There is also a situation that we experience, when we test people, sometimes they find it difficult to find them. The ambulances will go into community, people will flee their homes, and they make it difficult for us to find them. “Some of them sometimes shut their doors or they leave their environment to avoid being admitted." The commissioner added that the patients do not answer their phones as well. He added, “The ministry has no time to start hunting people around the community. “If you have tested positive, we expect you to cooperate with us and make yourself available so that you can be admitted and assessed. “Our isolation facilities are really comfortable, it is not like the Ebola days, we have made a lot of improvements. “Members of the executive and senior people in government have been admitted into those facilities. If I test positive, I will go to one of those facilities.”
