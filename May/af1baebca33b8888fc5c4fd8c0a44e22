Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammed Babandede, has feigned ignorance of his tenure extension as head of the agency for another two years. SaharaReporters had exclusively reported on Saturday how Babandede’s tenure was illegally extended by top persons in the Ministry of Interior and Presidency after some cool amount changed hands. Appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari on May 15, 2016, the 57-year-old under normal circumstances should retire from office in September after spending the statutory 35 years in service but got an extension after rubbing some ‘important’ palms. It was gathered that President Buhari had already given accent to the move, thereby clearing the way for Babandede, who is the longest serving NIS top officer, to remain at the helm of affairs of the agency for another two years.

2 Days Ago However, speaking with SaharaReporters on Monday, the NIS boss feigned ignorance of the development, saying that he had been away on annual and sick leave and only recently resumed duties, so could therefore not be involved in such an arrangement. He said, “I just returned from my annual and sick leave. I was in United Kingdom and on return self-isolated and later tested positive for COVID-19. How could I do all these under such condition?” When asked repeatedly by our correspondent if he knew his tenure had been extended, Babandede failed to respond, maintaining that he had no idea about the reported extension.
