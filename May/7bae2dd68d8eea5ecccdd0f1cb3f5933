The face off between Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Ali Pantami, and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerians In Diaspora Commission; Abike Dabiri-Erewa, assumed a new and messier twist after the minister's spokeperson, Uwa Suleiman, accused Dabiri-Erewa of crossing the line. The minister and NIDCOM boss had engaged in a disagreement since February this year after Pantami allegedly ordered the eviction of the agency from the building accommodating it. In an article written by Suleiman titled, "Abike Dabiri-Erewa: Season of falsehood, smear campaigns and ridiculous tactics", and posted on her twitter handle, she accused the NIDCOM boss of having a personal grudge against Pantami. Suleiman added that the decision of her boss not to shake hands with any woman was a personal principle and that if anyone felt offended by that they were free to go to court. She said, "Dr Pantami does not and will not shake any woman he is not married to. It is his personal principle. If anyone feels disrespected because they cannot shake Pantami’s hand, go to court. It is the absence of principles that leads to indiscipline, disregard for superior authority, falsehood and careless talk.
