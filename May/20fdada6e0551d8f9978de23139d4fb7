Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has ordered traditional rulers to set up task force teams in the respective communities to enforce the closure of markets, hotels and pubs in such places. Addressing traditional rulers at the Government House, Port Harcourt, the state capital, on Tuesday, Governor Wike said the shutdown was necessary to slowdown the spread of Coronavirus. He said, “Set up your own task force in your respective domains and implement the closure of markets, hotels and beer parlours. "This task force is strictly for COVID-19.  The state government will support all traditional rulers to carry out these responsibilities.” The governor also called on council chairmen to ensure they support the traditional rulers to deliver on the directive. Speaking further, Wike accused the Federal Government of playing politics with the issue of relocation of almajiris. He said, "When they started relocating the almajiris in the North, the Federal Government said nothing. “Immediately they heard that we have relocated some almajiris, they came up with the declaration that it was against the ban on inter-state movement. Why this double standard?" He disclosed that his administration had continued to work on the state's borders to ensure that they remained closed.
