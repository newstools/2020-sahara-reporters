Nollwood star, Olu Michaels, has distributed food items to residents of Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, and Ekiti to help cushion the effects of the Coronavirus lockdown in most parts of the country. The distribution of palliatives by government officials in different states of the federation has been marred by controversies with many individuals and families complaining of not receiving any item yet or getting foodstuffs not fit for human consumption. This is despite the billions of naira donated by wealthy individuals and corporate organisations for the provision of welfare items to Nigerians. According to Michaels, who called for more support for poor Nigerians during this period, food items worth over N5m were distributed by him to indigent persons and households across the four states this week. Speaking through his publicist, Gbolahan Adetayo, Michaels said, “I thought of my past and whenever I see people hungry, I will rather borrow to feed or help them. “I had nothing growing up until when I was over 30 years old. I know what hunger means and that is why I decided to support Nigerians from the resources God had blessed me with. “We have been to over 20 communities in Lagos State and then we went to Ogun, Ekiti and Oyo States. Only God sponsored the programme, not humans.” Beginning from May 4, residents of Lagos, Ogun and FCT, who had endured one month of lockdown put in place by President Muhammadu Buhari to curtail the spread of Coronavirus, will be able to resume work and businesses while maintaining strict social distancing guidelines. The move was taken by President Buhari after the complaint of hunger and lack became a daily message from the people.
