The Niger Delta Rights Advocates has accused the Interim Management Committee of the Niger Delta Development Commission of adopting various strategies to stop the probe of its activities by the National Assembly. According to the NDRA, the shutting down of NDDC headquarters on Thursday following the death of the agency’s Acting Director of Finance and Administration, Ibanga Bassey Etang, was a ploy to frustrate the investigation of a missing N40bn by the lawmakers. In a statement on Thursday, spokesperson for the group, Darlington Nwauju, said, “We received with surprise the shutdown of the NDDC headquarters in Port Harcourt by the Interim Management Committee.
