The African Action Congress has asked the Ondo State House of Assembly to set aside any political interest and investigate thoroughly the sum of N4.3bn inside a ‘secret’ account recently discovered. In a statement, the party's Chairman in Ondo, Alex Adeniyi, said that the outcome of the investigation would determine how independent the Assembly was in governance in the state.

The statement reads, "How much was the actual money deposited in the said account; who were managing the account on behalf of Ondo State Government and why was the said money not made known to the public and particularly the ODHA immediately the money was discovered? "From our end as a party working in the interest of the Ondo State citizens, we hereby call on the state’s House of Assembly to ensure due diligence and proper investigation is carried out to this act of fraud and the anti-graft agency should as a matter of urgency wade into the matter.” The party said the people of the state awaited the detailed of what transpired between 2008 that the account was actively run till the year 2018 when it was discovered. The party added that the state government must furnish the public with the interest that had accrued on the N4.3bn inside the ‘secret’ account.
