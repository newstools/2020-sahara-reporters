A former governor of Kaduna State, Balarabe Musa, has expressed displeasure with a policy initiated by northern governors, which has led to the repatriation of almajiris to their home states. Balarabe in an exclusive interview with SaharaReporters on Wednesday, said the deportation of the almajiri children was “highly irresponsible and against national unity”. He said, “It is highly irresponsible, it was done without relevant information and sadly it is an avoidance of responsibility. “It is against national unity. It is a national problem and it should be solved nationally, not by pushing the problem to another person. “The solution is free and compulsory primary and compulsory education for Nigerians wherever they live, together with easily available post-secondary education throughout Nigeria. "This is the solution to the problem of almajiri. Nigerians have been fighting for this since 1960 but all the Nigerian leaders have failed to do this. The only Nigerian leaders who faced this in a realistic way was late Obafemi Awolowo who introduced free education in the South-West.”
