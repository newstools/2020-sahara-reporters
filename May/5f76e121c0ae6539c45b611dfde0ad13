President of African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, has maintained his innocence as allegations of corruption and other forms of misconduct against him rise. The United States Department of Treasury had called for an independent of the allegations against Adesina despite the AfDB clearing him of all wrongdoing. In a statement on Wednesday, Adesina said, “In recent weeks and over the last few days especially, I have been overwhelmed by the tremendous support received from around the world. I have absolute confidence in the integrity of the Bank that I lead and its governance systems, rules and procedures. 

Akinwumi Adesina “In spite of unprecedented attempts by some to tarnish my reputation and prejudice the Bank’s governance procedures, I maintain my innocence with regard to trumped up allegations that unjustly seek to impugn my honour and integrity, as well as the reputation of the African Development Bank. “I sincerely appreciate the support of the bank’s shareholders.

As Martin Luther King Jnr. once said, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice”. “I am confident that fair, transparent, and just processes that respect the rules, procedures and governance systems of the Bank, and the rule of law, will ultimately prove that I have not violated the Code of Ethics of this extraordinary institution.”
