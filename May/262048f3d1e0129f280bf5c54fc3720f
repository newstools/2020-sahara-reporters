A federal lawmaker in Nigeria, Akinola Alabi, has asked the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to open up the country’s airports and ALSO allow inter-state travel to resume. Alabi, who represents Egbeda/Ona-Ara Federal Constituency, said this on his Twitter handle on Wednesday. He said, “Next phase of easing lockdown. Allow inter-state travel. Then open the airports and introduce some safety measures.” In other countries like South Africa and Ghana, easing of lockdown had been fingered as the cause of rise in Coronavirus cases.
