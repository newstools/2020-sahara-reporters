Former Special Assistant, Karure Tene-Omadide, to the Delta State Commissioner for Science and Technology, Matthew Tsekiri, has slammed his former boss with a suit, demanding a hundred million naira damages for defamation of character. It will be recalled that the embattled Tsekiri had, three months ago, sacked Tene-Omadide, over his refusal to continued remitting (40%) of his monthly salaries to his boss and his boss' girlfriend through their bank accounts. SaharaReporters reliably gathered that before his sack, Tene-Omadide had remitted through the commissioner's and his girlfriend's bank accounts, a total of N650,000 (50 per cent) out of an excess of N1,319,000 received between the months of engagement as demanded by the commissioner.  For what he described as defamation of character, Tene-Omadide has approached the Delta State High Court, sitting in Effurun, praying the court to direct Tsekiri and his media aide, Chris Anigbobi, to pay him N100m as compensation for damages suffered. In the suit marked EHC/76/2020, Tene-Omadide, is the claimant, while Chris Anigbobi and Matthew Tsekiri are first and second defendants respectively. In his written statement on oath, sighted by SaharaReporters, the claimant, Tene-Omadide posited that one Chris Anigbobi, who is Media Assistant to the Commissioner for Science and Technology, Matthew Tsekiri, made a defamatory publication against his person on March 25, 2020, accusing him among other seven allegations, of conspiring with the commissioner’s driver to steal the sum of N100, 000 from the commissioner’s official vehicle.

1 Month Ago The claimant, who stated that the commissioner endorsed and gave approval to the alleged defamatory content against his person, sought court relief that the first defendant’s claims were an imputation of crime and defamatory of his reputation and therefore seek N100m as ‘damages for defamation’ of his character and reputation. Among other things, the claimant is also seeking an order of the court compelling the defendants to pull down the said defamatory publication and render an apology to him through the same medium used in allegedly defaming him.
