Yobe State Commissioner for Health, Dr Muhammed Gana, has said that they were investigating reported rising mysterious deaths in some parts of the state. Gana, who is also the Vice-Chairman, Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control, spoke in Damaturu, the state capital, according to the News Agency of Nigeria. Gana said the mortality rate could not be easily attributed to Coronavirus pandemic. He however, said the state had already commenced investigation to ascertain the actual cause of the deaths, including carrying out autopsies to establish the cause(s) of deaths. He said, “You cannot conclude to say that when somebody died, the person died as a result of the epidemic. No, you have to establish the real cause of the death and the related items. “This is why we have always taken our time to investigate the causes before we reveal our findings.”
