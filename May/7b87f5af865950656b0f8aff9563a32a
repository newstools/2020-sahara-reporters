The National Assembly will on Thursday resume from its Sallah break to consider President Muhammadu Buhari’s Appropriation (Amendment) Bill 2020. The federal lawmakers went on a two-week Sallah break and were to reconvene on June 2. But a letter dated Tuesday, May 26, signed by the Clerk of the National Assembly, Alhaji Mohammed Sani-Omolori, and addressed to all senators and House members, stated that the lawmakers would resume plenary on Thursday to consider the appropriation of (Amendment) Bill, 2020.
