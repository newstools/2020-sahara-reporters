Labour unions in Kano State have resolved to embark on a seven-day warning strike in protest of the reduction in May salary of workers. The unions comprising of 13 labour groups also gave the government a 14-day ultimatum to reverse its decision to slash May salary or risk a strike action. The union said the reduction, which was already being effected, came without notice. Kabiru Ado Minjibir, Chairman of the Kano State Chapter of the Nigerian Labour Congress, while addressing journalists on Wednesday said the cut violates the 2019 minimum wage law and other international conventions and treaties that Nigeria is a signatory to. He said, “The Kano State Government has violated the existing minimum wage law, 2019 which is a product of tripartite committee entered into agreement sent to the legislature by the executive and signed by the President. “The state also failed to implement fully the signed agreement of the consequential adjustment arising from the implementation of N30,000 minimum wage to workers at local government level, primary healthcare, SUBEB (primary and secondary school teachers) tertiary institutions and ministry of justice, thereby unilaterally implement partially without the consent of the labour side representing them. “Healthcare and other frontline workers currently in contact with COVID-19 patients, testing and/or taking body specimen are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 and shall be categorised and motivated with occupational safety incentives, hazard allowances and clear policy on life insurance cover as implemented by the federal government.” He asked the government to immediately reverse the reduction and also ensure the payment of salary arrears of consequential adjustments to all categories of civil servants in the state.
