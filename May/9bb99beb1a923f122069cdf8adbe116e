A family member of late Borno State House of Assembly member, Umar Audi Jauro, has explained how the lawmaker died of COVID-19 complications. Jauro had died on Tuesday at University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital but his cause of death was not disclosed. But a family source on Thursday told SaharaReporters that he died after he contracted the deadly virus. He accused the hospital’s management of negligence. He said, “When we rushed him to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, he was initially rejected, they told us there was no bed space. “It was after he was admitted that his sample was taken and sent to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control and it came out positive after his death.” His death comes barely a week after Wakil Bukar, lawmaker representing Nganzai Constituency, died of Coronavirus.
