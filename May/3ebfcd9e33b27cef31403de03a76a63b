Agnes Akpan, mother of the Nigerian journalist, Kufre Carter, detained by the Department of State Services for allegedly criticising the Commissioner for Health in Akwa Ibom State, Dominic Ukpong, has protested after she was denied access to her son on Saturday. Carter, a sports journalist based in the state, was arrested over allegations that he defamed Ukpong in a phone conversation. In a video on Saturday, Akpan lamented the ill treatment of her son and accused the Nigerian Government of causing her trauma.  She said, "I am here in DSS, my son did not commit any crime. Even families of armed robbers are permitted to see their son in a cell and see how he is doing.
