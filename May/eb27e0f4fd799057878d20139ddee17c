An Abuja-based group known as Obaseki Mandate Forum has obtained nomination form for the re-electionÂ of Godwin Obaseki in Edo State few hour after Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu picked his own form. Chairman of the forum said most of the members of the group are card-caring members of APC in Edo State. The political situation in the state is becoming tensed as gladiators in the ruling party preparing for a showdown during the governorship election in October.
