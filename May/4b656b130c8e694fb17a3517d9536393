Yinka Odumakin, Secretary-General of Afenifere, has attributed the recent war of words between Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, and Isa Ali Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, to the lack of integration within the All Progressives Congress and the Presidency. Recall that Dabiri-Erewa revealed in an interview how gunmen chased the commission’s staff from office on the orders of Pantami. The matter degenerated with key agencies taking sides as well as the United Kingdom Chapter of the APC backing Dabiri-Erewa. Reacting to the face-off during an interview with SaharaReporters, Odumakin said the Presidency act like people not united and are targeting personal goals and victory.

He said, “Buhari doesn’t intervene in this kind of thing just like the case of the late Chief of Staff and Defence Minister. He doesn’t intervene in this kind of thing except it is a matter that affects him. “A place that people there are not integrated and everybody is pursuing his or her agenda, you will have the kind of thing that you are having now.
