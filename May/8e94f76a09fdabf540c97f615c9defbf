Barely 24 hours after a deadly communal clash left about 15 persons dead, gunmen have attacked another community and torched buildings in Adamawa State. The attackers, who stormed Mbemun, a coastal village under Lamurde Local Government Area, also carted away cattle and other livestock. Chairman of Lamurde local government council, Burto William, confirmed the attack to SaharaReporters. He said, "Gunmen have attacked Mbemun, a community under our local government last night and burnt the entire village. "Vehicles were also burnt, just as the assailants stole cows and other domestic animals of large commercial value." Another resident of the community, Bandrus James, who managed to escape, corroboratedÂ  the development, saying, "Gunmen suspected to be herdsman stormed the village about 1:00am on Saturday and burnt down the whole village. "Though no life was lost, all our cattle have been carted away and our foodstuffs destroyed."
