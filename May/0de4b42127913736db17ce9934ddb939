Nigeria's ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, has accused the country's media of not fairly reporting killings in the society. The party said that the number of killings that had occurred under the President Muhammadu Buhari administration was extremely higher than what was being reported in the media. The APC made the comments on one of its Twitter handles managed by Philip Obin on Sunday in reaction to a story by SaharaReporters. Muhammadu Buhari SaharaReporters had earlier reported how Bandits attacked a village in Katsina State, leading to the death of three persons and the destruction of valuables. Commenting under the SaharaReporters' post, the APC said, "Over 200 killed in Erei, Biase LGA of Cross River State and Nigerian media and @HQNigerianArmy are silent because it's not Southern Kaduna or North-East?" To buttress its claim, the APC attached gory pictures of distressed persons to the Twitter post.  Over 200 killed in Erei, Biase LGA of Cross River State and Nigeria Media and @HQNigerianArmy are silent because it's not Southern Kaduna or North East?SeeÂ https://t.co/3Hj96IvrJL pic.twitter.com/85xi30Fzcs
