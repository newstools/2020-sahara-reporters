Ogun State has extended the ongoing lockdown due to more cases of COVID-19 being recorded. This was announced by Governor Dapo Abiodun while speaking with journalists on Friday. He said that though painful, the lockdown would curb the spread of the virus. He however, said that Monday, Wednesday and Friday would be open for residents of the state to restock their homes with basic necessities. He said, “We cannot ignore the fact that we are having a sudden rise in the number of new cases. We all decried an increase of 30 per cent last week when I was giving the weekly update. “This week’s increase of over 37 percent is even more worrisome, particularly as we are still under an eased lockdown, and considering the demography and location of the confirmed cases, we can confirm that community transmission is on the increase in our state. “I have to state that after all considerations, we are constrained to take the painful, but necessary decision to continue the eased lockdown of Ogun State for another one week till Sunday, May 31. “As we have always maintained the delicate balance between lives and livelihood, we will continue to have our window of relaxation, from 7 am to 5 pm on Monday, 25th May; Wednesday, 27th May, and Friday, 29th May. “We must also bear in mind that the daily curfew from 8 pm to 6 am and the ban on non-essential inter-state travel as directed by Mr. President still stand.” Abiodun announced that the second phase of lockdown would begin from June 1 with the expansion of the windows of relaxation.
