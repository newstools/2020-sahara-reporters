Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State says the peace deal signed between his administration and leaders of repentant bandits in the state has not collapsed. Matawalle said he would continue to honour the agreement reached with the bandits, who chose the path of peace, but would confront those, who reneged with the full force of the law. The governor stated this on Saturday in Gusau while condoling families of those attacked by bandits in some villages in the state last week. He sympathised with families affected by the recent wave of banditry in the villages of Unguwar Rogo, Karda, Bidda and Kajera under Tsafe Local Government Area as well as Kabaje of Kaura-Namoda LGA. The attacks in the affected villages left no fewer than 10 persons dead and several others wounded before the arrival of security agents. The governor said, “I have been working round the clock, having sleepless nights, holding meetings with the security chieftains and other stakeholders.
