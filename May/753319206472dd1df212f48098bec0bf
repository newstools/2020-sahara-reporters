Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has denied solely taking the decision to demolish two hotels in the state for violation of Coronavirus lockdown order. The governor made the comments on Tuesday after coming under intense public fire for several days with many individuals and groups calling for his ‘head’. He said, "I don't take decisions alone in the fight against COVID-19. All decisions are taken by the State Security Council and they are for the overall interest of Rivers people. 

Governor Nyesom Wike "You know people applaud government decisions when it suits them but when it does not favour them they say it is politically motivated. "Rivers State Government does not have anything against hoteliers in the state, but decided to shut down their activities because some cases of COVID-19 were recorded in hotels." Governor Wike also blamed the hoteliers for failing to assist government in providing relevant information regarding those that test positive for Coronavirus in their facilities. According to him, adequate information would have helped the state’s Ministry of Health and other relevant agencies to carry out proper contact tracing.
