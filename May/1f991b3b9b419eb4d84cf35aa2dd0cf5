Coalition of Civil Society and Deltans on Tuesday took to the streets of Asaba, the Delta State capital, in a peaceful protest against a new tax bill sent to the state’s House of Assembly by the state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, and refusal of the House to organise a public hearing. The bill, which was introduced on the floor of the House for the first time on April 30, 2020, through a letter from the Delta State governor passed first and second reading on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively last week. The protest led by the Director-General, Conference for the Actualisation of Human Rights, Maxwell Ogedegbe, charged the state House of Assembly to take a cue from their federal counterparts, who were halted over an accelerated process of the bill on infectious diseases upon public outcry for failing to conduct a public hearing.
