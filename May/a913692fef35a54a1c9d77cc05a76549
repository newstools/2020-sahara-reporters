Chairman of Adamawa State Containment Committee, who is also the Secretary to the State Government, Bashiru Ahmad, has said that Gombe State Government only sent 38 suspected Coronavirus patients to them and not 42 confirmed cases as claimed in some quarters. He said, "Based on this protocol, Gombe State had actually handed over 38 of such travellers of Adamawa origin to us. "And in that regard, we have sent their samples to the Abuja laboratory for testing, and results of 29 of them have showed negative. "And based on the advice of our WHO technical partners, the remaining nine of them have been advised to go on self isolation for 14 days. "Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that 42 COVID-19 patients of Adamawa origin were handed over to us from Gombe."
