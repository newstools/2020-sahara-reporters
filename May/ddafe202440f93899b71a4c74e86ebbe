A United Nations war prosecutor has said that the remains of one of the mastermind’s of the murder of former Rwandan Prime Minister had been identified by DNA testing. According to Serge Brammertz, Mr Augustine Bizimana died in 2000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and all tests done on the remains prove him to be the one. The downing of the aircraft carrying former resident, Juvenal Habyarimana, led to the massacre of 800,000 people in 100 days. His Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, was killed a day after during the early stages of the slaughter.

According to the statement, prosecutors conducted DNA analysis “late last year” on remains that had earlier been recovered from a grave site in Pointe Noire in Dr Congo. “Subsequent investigations and comparative DNA analysis over the last several months ruled out that the remains were those of any other person,” it said. The prosecutor stated that his office is still searching out the former commander of the Presidential Guard of the Rwandan Armed Forces, Protais Mpiranya, and five other Rwandan suspects. “The key lesson from the death of Augustin Bizimana is that the world should give timely justice,” the secretary of genocide survivors’ organisation – Ibuka Naphtal Ahishakiye, told Reuters.
