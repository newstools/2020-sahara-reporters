The Benue State Government on Saturday said it will no longer push for the re-opening of worship places and market. The government had on Thursday said it would commence the re-opening of worship centres and markets, which have been closed for close to two months due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It also directed workers on grade levels one to 12 asked to stay at home about two months ago to resume work on June 1, 2020 but advised that they always wear face mask and maintain social distancing as they go to work. The reversal, Governor Samuel Ortom said, was premised on the federal governmentâ€™s advice to states to be cautious about restarting economic and social activities. According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Benue has recorded five cases of COVID-19 as of Friday.
