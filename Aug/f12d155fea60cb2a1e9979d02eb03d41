THISDAYLIVE This and others were some of the submissions contained in the paper Ortom presented on Tuesday during a virtual meeting convened by the Centre for Values in Leadership, in collaboration with Nigeria Governors’ Forum. In the paper titled ‘Insecurity and Governance Challenges in the New Normal’, Ortom said governments at all levels must come to terms with the fact that insecurity is a real threat to the development of the country and must be willing to tackle the menace sincerely. He also recommended adequate funding of security agencies and continuous training of their personnel to enable them to be abreast of global dynamics in the fight against insecurity. The governor urged the Nigerian government to embrace ranching as it remained the global best practice of animal husbandry, adding that it was also crucial for the apex government to enact a law to end open grazing. According to the statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, Ortom also advocated improved educational standards and enhanced public enlightenment campaigns to give the people, particularly youths the needed orientation to shun negative acts and become more patriotic.
