A Sharia council has asked the Kano State Government to immediately execute Yahaya Sharif Aminu, a musician, who alleged to have sang a blasphemous song against Prophet Muhammad. The Sharia court in a judgment by Khadi Aliyu Muhammad Kani found Aminu guilty and sentenced him to death by hanging.  But despite the global outcry, the Supreme Council for Shari’ah in Nigeria in a statement by its General Secretary, Nafi’u Baba-Ahmad, said the Kano Government must execute the musician to deter others from engaging in same act, NAN reports.
