Everywhere else, I'm a symbol of equality A perfect representation of impartiality A goddess who has no regards for wealth or power Who duly metes out justice by the hour  All over the world, I am a beacon of hope and truth Who treats equally the aged and the youth Who does not discriminate against ethnicity or race And cares not about the colour of your face  But here, I'm the poster lady of a corrupt system An unwilling tool in the battle of supremacy Having no power to defeat or resist them A weapon used to silence the enemy  Here, I am a victim who lives in fear Of those who have ripped off my blindfold And asked me to be brazenly insincere To only do as I'm being told  Here, my sword is stained with the blood of the innocent My scales weigh heavy with guilt and regrets Here I am always part of an atrocious plan Never the hope of the common man
