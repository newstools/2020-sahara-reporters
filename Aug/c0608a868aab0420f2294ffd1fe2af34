Women Commission of the Trade Union Congress, Lagos State chapter, on Thursday called on the Nigerian Government to end rape and sexual violence against women and girls across the country. Chairperson of the union, Yemisi Oyejide, made the call on Thursday while leading a peaceful protest condemning rape at the Lagos State House of Assembly complex.  Oyejide said incidents of rape perpetrated daily had gotten to a peak that all well-meaning Nigerians must condemn the act and see to it that offenders were heavily punished.  She stressed that the situation had become worrisome that some parents no longer allowed their daughters to visit friends due to the situation. She also lamented that perpetrators of such crimes against women and girls were often left off the hook.
