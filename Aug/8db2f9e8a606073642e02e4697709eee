We saw the military evacuating their people both killed and wounded,” a resident told SaharaReporters. The sources said several weapons and ammunition were stolen by the terrorists during the attack that lasted for three hours. Boko Haram and its offshoot, ISWAP, have killed thousands and displaced millions in North-Eastern Nigeria. The Nigerian Army has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency has been largely defeated and frequently underplays any losses. In the past months, soldiers have been targeted by the insurgents, who lay ambush on their path. See Also
