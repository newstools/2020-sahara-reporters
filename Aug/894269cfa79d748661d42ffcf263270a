The police have arraigned 18 Nigerians before the Wa Circuit Court for allegedly entering the ghana illegally to engage in cybercrime.

"The 18 Nigerians claimed they entered the country in April this year through unapproved routes at the time the borders had been closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic," Superintendent R.A. Boateng of the Ghana Police Service said. According to him, the foreigners travelled to Wa in the Upper West Region where they rented two houses at Dobile, a suburb of Wa, from where they operated their cybercrime activities. Upon intelligence gathered, a team of security personnel swooped on the two houses in the early hours of Saturday to arrest them. According to a report by Ghanaweb, the police retrieved items, including 22 laptop computers and their accessories, 11 mobile phones, and a camera. These devices were believed to be used to commit the crime when a search was conducted in their rooms.
