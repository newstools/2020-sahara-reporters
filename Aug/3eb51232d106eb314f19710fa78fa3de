Gabriel Ogbonna, a lawyer arrested on the orders of Okezie Ikpeazu, Abia State governor, over a Facebook post, has filed legal action against the Director-General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Magaji Bichi. The DSS, widely known for its flagrant disregard for the law, arrested Ogbonna on April 29, 2020, when he was released on bail by the court. He has since been in the detention of the security agency. Emperor Gabriel Ogbonna "He was released to the DSS officials and officials of Abia State Government on orders from above, they wanted to deal with him," a source told SaharaReporters at the time. More than three months after his detention, Ogbonna prayed the Federal High Court, Abuja, to detain Bichi in prison over contempt of court. Ogbonna asked the court to keep the DSS DG in custody until he obeys the order of the court, that he (Ogbonna) be released on bail. In the suit filed by his legal counsel, Monday Ubani, Esq., he informed the court that the health and life of Ogbonna was now in danger due to the illegal incarceration he is being subjected to by the DSS.
