6 Days Ago An informed source, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said the office of the AGF had previously attempted to usurp the powers of the EFCC and other law enforcement agencies with respect to the sale of forfeited assets with an illegal directive giving power of coordinating the sale and management of forfeited assets to his office. “Contrary to public display of coordinating concern by the Attorney General’s office, the underlying interest was percentage from this sale for Malami and his contractor lawyer friends. “Malami had two years ago granted authority to his main partners and fronts in the assets recovery to sell a vessel already forfeited to the government by the EFCC. “Without any authorisation or coordination with EFCC, Mr Okpeseyi (SAN), sold the vessel for N153m and collected all possible commissions,” the source said. It was, however, revealed that the Navy refused to release the vessel, as due process was not followed in its selling by Malami and his associates. See Also

Some of the top officials are, however, insisting that Malami followed due process in overseeing other agencies in the country. “Under the law, the constitution is supreme and it is followed by any enactment of the National Assembly. “A directive or regulation like the AGF’s regulation on the assets recovery remains illegal in the face of conflict with an Act of parliament like EFCC Act. “Some of us are dogged to ensure the enforcement of his directive on assets recovery and control over the dissipation,” the source stated.
