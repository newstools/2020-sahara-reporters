Following Saturday's local government election in Ondo State, some youth in Akure North Local Government Area have protested against the violence and irregularities, which marred the exercise. The youth, who took to the streets, complained that the election result especially in Oba Ile had been declared at the ward centres but were surprised it was put on hold during announcement. A total of 10 political parties participated in the election, which held in the 18 local government areas of the state.  The All Progressives Congress was declared winner in all the local government areas while the Peoples Democratic Party and Zenith Labour Party boycotted the election. Armed with placards, the protesting youth also accused a serving commissioner in the state of hijacking election materials in Oba Ile. Speaking during the protest, one of the youth and councillorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Mr Johnson Faloye, said he was declared winner in the election in Unit 09 of Oba Ile in Akure North Local Government Area but the result was manipulated in favour of his opponent in APC, Korede Folorunsho.
