About 148 students, who hail from Gusau and Tsafe Federal Constituency in Zamfara State, have appealed to their lawmaker, Kabiru Amadu Mai Palace, to fulfill his promise to pay their tuition in Sokoto State University. The students, who reached out to SaharaReporters, said they were on the brink of expulsion because of their inability to pay the fees.  The Sokoto State University had, in 2019, increased tuition by over 100 per cent for the new academic session and issued a seven-day ultimatum for students to comply or withdraw from the university. Owing to the tuition hike, SaharaReporters learnt some of the affected students lost their admission while others had to drop out. After the public outcry and complaints, Mai Palace promised to pay the tuition of students from his constituencies to alleviate their plight. One of the affected students said, "Last year, Sokoto State University introduced high tuition, which led many to drop out of the school.  "Those affected from Zamfara sought support from elites in the state, including senators and members of the House of Representatives in their constituencies. "Hon Kabiru Mai appointed a screening committee to collate the names of the affected students from his constituency. The committee has not been able to reach him since, which made all their efforts abortive. "This has led many students from his constituency to drop out of the university. We want to beg Hon Kabiru Mai to please consider these students and help pay their tuition fees as he promised."
