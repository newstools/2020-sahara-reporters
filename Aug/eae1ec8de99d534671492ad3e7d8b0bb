Irate youth on Monday attacked the palace of Onire of Ire Ekiti in Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Oba Bobade Adeleke, after the monarch invited security operatives to prevent them from holding Ogun Festival due to COVID-19. SaharaReporters learnt that the traditional ruler and his council had earlier passed a resolution that the 2020 Ogun Festival in the town won't be celebrated elaborately because of COVID-19 and adherence to its protocols.
