The statement reads, “The recent attack against peaceful revolution is highly condemned by the CUPP. Nigeria is a democratic state and as such citizens are afforded the constitutional right to engage in peaceful protest. “The Presidency is therefore called to immediately hold the police and other security outfits accountable for the incessant violence and infringement of the rights of the masses. Nigeria has been liberated from the deadly claws of the military regime.
