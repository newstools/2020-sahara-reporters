3 Days Ago A member of the local vigilante group had confirmed the abduction of the victims. SaharaReporters gathered that family members of the victims had pleaded with the kidnappers to reduce the ransom to what they could afford. One of them disclosed that they were able to raise N100, 000 but the abductors turned down the offer. He said, "Their (abductors) demand is just too much for us but we are still pleading with them to have it reduced. "Our brothers have spent five days in their den now and we don't even know their condition but we are not happy. "We are just afraid of these guys, and we are calling on the state government to help us out. The issue of insecurity in this axis is causing us a nightmare." When contacted, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, spokesperson for the Ondo State Police Command, said joint security operatives made up of the police, military and members of the Amotekun Corps were combing the bushes in the Akoko axis to rescue the two victims.
