Members of the Nigeria Union of Journalists in Akwa Ibom State has resolved to boycott a press conference planned for Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, who is presently in the state. In a statement on Friday, the chapter directed all journalists not to attend any activity organised by the former minister.  Fani-Kayode has come under heavy criticism for calling a journalist, Eyo Charles, “stupid” during a press conference in Calabar, Cross River State. The journalist was said to have asked Fani-Kayode, who bankrolled his recent tour of some Southern states. The former minister, who was infuriated by the question, said the journalist was stupid. Fani-Kayode has since apologised for his comments.
