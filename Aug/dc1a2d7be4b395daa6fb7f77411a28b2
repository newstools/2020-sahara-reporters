The Independent National Electoral Commission says it has set up a dedicated portal where election results from polling units can be viewed in real time. Festus Okoye, INEC spokesperson, disclosed this on Thursday.  Okoye said the use of the portal will start with the Nasarawa Central Constituency election after which it will also be deployed in Edo and Ondo governorship polls. He further said the portal will strengthen the transparency in the election result management system.
