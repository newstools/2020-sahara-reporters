Warring communities in Southern Kaduna have agreed to sheath their swords after a peace meeting between Atyap, Fulani and Hausa communities in the area.

The communique reads, "The meeting appreciated the fact that all Nigerians have the constitutional or fundamental rights to move and reside anywhere in Nigeria, including Atyap Chiefdom, without any fear, molestation or harassment from anybody or any source whatsoever. "The summit therefore called on the authorities to facilitate the return of displaced persons. "It recommended the establishment of a standing peace committee that should comprise of Hausa, Fulani and Atyap and their youth to organise robust engagement/dialogue on security issues from time to time with a view to sustaining peaceful coexistence.‚Äù Meanwhile, President of Southern Kaduna People's Union, Jonathan Asake, and spokeperson of the group, Luka Binniyat, confirmed the presence of the union at the meeting.
