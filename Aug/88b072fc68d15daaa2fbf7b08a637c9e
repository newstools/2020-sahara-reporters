The cleric revealed his status on Sunday after the Nigeria Center for Disease Control confirmed that the result of his test was positive. In a statement, Mamza disclosed that he was positive and in isolation for the virus. He said, "NCDC test result confirmed that I have contracted the virus, therefore I'm now in total isolation and on treatment. "One lesson that I want people to appreciate and understand is that everybody has to make himself available for testing if need be.
