Recall that late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari, was treated for Coronavirus at the same hospital until he died in April. Also, former governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, and lawmaker representing Lagos East Senatorial district at the National Assembly, Adebayo Osinowo, both died at the hospital in June. The hospital is a top choice among wealthy Nigerians seeking cardiovascular treatment and has been in operation since 2008. It had handled a handful of Coronavirus patients among Nigerian politicians and elites in recent times.
