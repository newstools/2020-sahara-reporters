The Bayelsa State Governorship Election Tribunal sitting in Abuja has annulled the election of Duoye Diri, governor of Bayelsa State. The election was nullified based on a petition by the Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party, which argued that it was unlawfully excluded from participating in the election. Duoye Diri Diri, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, was sworn in as governor after the Supreme Court sacked David Lyon as governor-elect 24 hours before his inauguration. In a majority judgment delivered by Justice Yunusa Musa in the petition, the tribunal held that the Independent National Electoral Commission unlawfully excluded ANDP from the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state. It, therefore, ordered INEC to conduct a fresh governorship election in Bayelsa State within 90 days.
