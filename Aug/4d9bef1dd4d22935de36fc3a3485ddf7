The Nigerian Bar Association has withdrawn its invitation to Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State to speak at the associationâ€™s annual general conference. The association took the decision at its just concluded National Executive Committee meeting. NBA said it took the decision so that the governor can have more time to focus on the killings in Southern part of Kaduna State.  Several Nigerian lawyers had in the past days registered their discontent over the decision of the leadership of the NBA to include Governor el-Rufai as a guest speaker in the conference. The conference holds from August 26-29. See Also
