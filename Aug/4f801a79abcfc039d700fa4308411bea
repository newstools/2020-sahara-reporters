Four Malian soldiers were killed and one seriously injured on Saturday when an explosive device detonated as their vehicle drove by in the centre of the country, a military source told AFP. The explosion in the Koro region near Mali’s border with Burkina Faso, comes just days after a military putsch against President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. In another development, West African envoys will meet ousted Keita on Saturday, a member of the delegation said. The envoys are due to meet members of the junta at 4:00pm local time and will then meet Keita, who was detained by the rebel soldiers in Tuesday’s putsch along with a number of other Malian government and army officials, the source from the West African bloc ECOWAS said on condition of anonymity.
