2 Days Ago SaharaReporters had reported how the election was marred by snatching of ballot boxes and ballot paper. In a statement by the party's spokesperson, Kennedy Ikantu Peretti, the PDP said the local council election was marked with unpardonable brigandage. It reads, "In thousands of polling units, neither voting materials nor ODIEC personnel were seen at about noon on election day and where they were seen, ballot papers were in short supply." In his reaction, Chairman of APC in Ondo State, Ade Adetimehin, said the conduct of the election was timely, commending security agencies for ensuring safety during the exercise.
