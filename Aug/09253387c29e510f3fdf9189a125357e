Despite the prevalence of COVID-19 in the country, students of Osun State College of Education, Ila-Orangun, have given the Nigerian Government one month ultimatum to reopen schools for academic activities or face mass action. In a statement by Comrade Olanrewaju Tajudeen, Students Union Government President of the school, the undergraduates of the college said they were running out of patience with the shutting down of all campuses in Nigeria.  They said tertiary schools in Nigeria must be reopened for academic activities on or before September 24 this year. The students wondered why the government would allow campaigns and elections to be held in Edo and Ondo states but shut down schools. The statement reads, "Nigeria locked down all her tertiary institutions several months ago, with the hope of curtailing the spread of the novel virus supposedly for the safety of every Nigerian. "If Uwa, Vera, and Baraka were in the school, maybe the tables would have turned and death from violent sex wouldn't have been their lot. "Why must Edo and Ondo campaigns and elections hold if you care for these millions? "We have passed messages to the government to ensure that facilities for online lectures were met and we can also receive lectures from home. "Hence, our schools must be reopened fully for academic activities on or before 14th September 2020. "To be as straightforward as possible, we stand to announce and warn all concerned authorities that our silence is not timidity and our fragility over the months has been nothing but humility."
