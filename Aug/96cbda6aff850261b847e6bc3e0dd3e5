The police in Delta State have arrested a yet to be named man for falsely parading himself as a Major in the Nigerian Army. SaharaReporters gathered that the man was arrested earlier in the week along Sapele Road in the state.  He was caught with a fake military van conveying 420 packs of compressed weed suspected to be Indian hemp. A police source said the suspect will be prosecuted at the end of ongoing investigation into the incident.
