Two nurses and one other person have been arrested for stealing and selling a newborn baby by the police in Katsina State. SaharaReporters gathered that one Shamsiya Sani, 25, a resident of Dandagoro Quarters, Katsina, was delivered of a baby girl at a clinic around  Kofar Kaura Quarters and was said to have abandoned the baby shortly after the delivery with a note. The two nurses, Misira Tijjani and Grace Ejigu, were alleged to have conspired and sold the child to one Mrs Eucharia Onyema of Sabuwar Kasuwa Quarters, Katsina.
