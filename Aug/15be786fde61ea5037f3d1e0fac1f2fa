The Senate of the University of Lagos, Akoka, has rejected the removal of Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe as Vice Chancellor of the institution by the Governing Council. Led by Wale Babalakin, Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Governing Council, the decision-making organ on Wednesday in Abuja removed Ogundipe as VC of UNILAG, accusing him of gross misconduct and acts of corruption. But in a meeting held on Thursday by 88 members and anchored by Prof Chioma Ago, a former Dean of the Faculty of Law, the institution’s Senate said the removal of Ogundipe was against UNILAG’s regulation, adding that the Council removed Ogundipe without giving him the opportunity to defend himself.
