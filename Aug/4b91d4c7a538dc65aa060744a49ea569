The prime suspect in connection with incessant ritual killings of residents of Akinyele area of Ibadan in Oyo State, Sunday Shodipe, who escaped from police custody, has killed another woman in the community. The incident occurred on Saturday when the fugitive sneaked into the room of a woman identified as Funmilayo (Iya Ibeji) and smashed her head with an object believed to be a cutlass. A friend of the victim was said to have alerted neighbours, who rushed her to a private hospital, where they stitched her head but later referred her to the University College Hospital because of the severity of the injuries.  She was also rejected because of lack of bed space. SaharaReporters gathered that she was later taken to Adeoyo Hospital at Ring Road where she died as a result of lack of proper medical attention to save her life. See Also
