The Military Task Force has arrested six suspects in connection with the killings in the southern part of Kaduna State. The suspects are Abubakar Ali, Ali Amadu, Bawa Idi, Umar Dikko, Garba Damon and Mohammed Ibrahim, Adamu Joseph and William Barnabas.  Commander of the Task Force, Maj.-Gen Chukwuemeka Okonkwo, paraded the suspects in Kafanchan, on Monday. Recall that hundreds of Southern Kaduna women on Saturday in different communities took to major roads to display their displeasure over the incessant killings of their people by Fulani militia. The protesters, who trooped out in large numbers in Samaru Kataf in Zango Kataf Local Government Area, called on the government at different levels to tackle the situation. Speaking on behalf of the protesters, Mrs Dorcas David called on the Kaduna State Government to remove the curfew imposed in the area as a matter of urgency.
