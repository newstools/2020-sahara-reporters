1 Week Ago Yakubu also lamented the low turnout of voters during election as he called for a massive voter education. He faulted the current electoral law in the country, saying it will continue to deny Nigerians the right to vote. “We engaged about one million ad hoc staff during the last general elections. This means that the staff and others deployed for election duties did not vote. “I want to appeal to the Senate to please expedite work on the Electoral Act so that we can conduct elections in an atmosphere of certainty. “I hope you will give us electoral Act by the end of first quarter of 2021,” he said. He also noted that the passage of the amended law will hugely contribute to the success of 2020 election. See Also
