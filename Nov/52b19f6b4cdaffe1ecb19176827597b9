Unidentified persons on Monday attacked oil facilities operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company and Nigerian Agip Oil Company at Ikarama community, Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa. Mr Ben Warder, a youth leader in Ikarama near the incident site, said on Tuesday that residents heard several sounds from the explosion that rocked the oil fields on Monday but were too scared to approach the area.

He said, “We have report of an interference on our pipeline about 1 kilometre from Ikarama community in Bayelsa State. “We immediately shut-in the line and we have informed the relevant regulatory government agencies and stakeholders. “A government-led joint investigation team will determine the cause of the interference.”
