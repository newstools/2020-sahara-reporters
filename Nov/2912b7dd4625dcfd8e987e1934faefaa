Players in Nigeria’s national team, Super Eagles, have all tested negative to COVID-19 ahead of Tuesday’s 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sierra Leone. The new results make it the second time the Super Eagles would test negative for the virus in five days and clear them for the game.  The Eagles delegation departed Nigeria on Monday morning at about 9:20am aboard a chartered flight from Benin City, Edo State, to Freetown, Sierra Leone without Victor Osimhen, who left camp earlier on Sunday following a shoulder injury. The team will clash with the Leone Stars at the Siaka Stevens Stadium in Freetown.
