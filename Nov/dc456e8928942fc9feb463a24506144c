Business Insider As part of moves to ensure that the vaccine circulated round the world, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in a statement signed by the duo announced on Thursday that it would commit an additional $70m to make sure vaccines are available for everyone —  not just those, who could afford them. It reads, “COVID-19 anywhere is COVID-19 everywhere. That is why we have to ensure that everyone gets equal access to tests, drugs, and vaccines when they are available -- no matter where you live in the world." The new vaccine also faces challenges in distribution because it requires special ultra-low-temperature freezers that aren't found in typical doctor's offices — an issue that led many to speculate there could be disparities in its administration.
