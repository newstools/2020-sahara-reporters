1 Hour Ago Justice Abang had on Monday ordered that Senator Ali Ndume be remanded at Kuje Correctional Centre for failing to produce Maina in court. Ndume stood surety for Maina, who has continued to absent himself from his ongoing trial. The judge ordered the remand of Ndume pending the fulfillment of his bail bond, which is a forfeiture of N500m to the Nigerian Government. The court had declared Maina wanted and also ordered his trial in absentia. SaharaReporters gathered that Senator Ndume spent the night at Kuje Correctional Center and would be returning to the court to approach the judge to release him on self-recognition.
