The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the suit brought by the Alliance for Democracy, Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party and LM against Bayelsa State deputy governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, and Accord Party’s case against Governor Douye Diri. In a unanimous judgment delivered by Justice Sylvester Ngwuta, the apex court predicated the dismissal of the appeals on the withdrawal of the six appeals by lawyers of the appellants.  Diri’s victory has been challenged a number of times but the Bayelsa State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja at different times affirmed Diri as the duly elected governor of the state. Governor Duoye Diri was sworn in on February 14, a day after the Supreme Court sacked the former governor-elect of Bayelsa State, David Lyon, and his deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremieoyo. Lyon’s election was nullified after his deputy was accused of submitting forged certificates to the Independent National Electoral Commission.
