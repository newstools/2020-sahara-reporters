The Nigeria Labour Congress has asked the Nigerian government to revert to the old pump price of N158 petrol or face indefinite strike from workers. The labour union said that the recent increase in fuel price was a breach of an agreement with the government at previous negotiations.  NLC president, Ayuba Wabba, in a statement, said the union would not accept such arbitrary increases in the price of petrol. According to the statement, the increase has also cast in a very bad light organised labour’s utmost good faith with regards to government explanations that it lacks funds to continue bankrolling the so-called subsidy payments. “Nigerians cannot be made to bleed endlessly, for the failures of successive governments, to properly manage our refineries, ensure value for money for the numerous turnaround maintenance, which was poorly executed,” the NLC said.
