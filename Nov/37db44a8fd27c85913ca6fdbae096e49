Two Sharia court judges from Zamfara State, who were kidnapped by bandits while on transit from Niger Republic two months ago, have regained freedom. The judges, Sabiu Abdullahi and Shafi’i Jangebe, were abducted on their way back to Zamfara after a trip to Niger Republic.  A relative of Abdullahi, who is also the Deputy Chief Imam of Usaimin Juma'at Mosque in Gusau, confirmed the release of the judges to SaharaReporters. He said N2m was paid to the bandits before they were released. “They initially asked us to pay N20m but when they realised that we could not produce the amount after several days in captivity, they told us to bring N2m,” the source said.
