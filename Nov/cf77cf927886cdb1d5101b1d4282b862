The police in Uganda have killed no less than seven people after the arrest of popular rights activist and opposition leader, Bobi Wine. Wine, 38, who is also a presidential hopeful for the January 2021 general elections in the country, has faced multiple arrests and harassment since he decided to run against 76-year-old dictator, Yoweri Museveni.  He was arrested on Wednesday after police violently broke into his vehicle and took him into custody. Fred Nyanzi, Wine’s brother, confirming his arrest said, “Bobi has been arrested this morning in Luuka town, but we do not know his whereabouts right now.” His arrest sparked nationwide protest, which the police tried to disperse by firing live bullets, killing seven persons in the process. More than 38 others were also injured in the protest. Meanwhile, Wine has remained defiant, tweeting shortly after his arrest, “Resistance against tyranny is not only a right, it is a duty for oppressed people to carry out! #WeAreRemovingADictator.”
