A young man named Adediran Rotimi has narrated his experience at the hands of some operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, who framed him for Internet fraud. He said despite committing no offense, the EFCC operatives paraded him alongside other suspected Internet fraudsters.  The EFCC had on October 14 announced that it had arrested nine suspected Internet fraudsters in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Narrating his ordeal on Twitter, Rotimi said he was at home when the operatives broke in at the dead of the night and whisked him away. He said the commission seized his mobile phones and laptop and detained him without carrying out an investigation. He said, “EFCC broke into my apartment around 4:00am on this day and arrested me at gunpoint. At first I thought they were armed robbers because of their mode of operation but after seeing their jacket, I was calm since I don't have anything incriminating  ...on me, but little did I know that I am automatically a suspect for owning laptop and smart phones. They collected one Android phone, one iPhone and one small itel phone, I was still very calm because I am not into cyber crime but my story changed when I got to their office  "At Ibadan, without investigation they took my pictures alongside others and uploaded it online, my heart was broken because my image has been ruined because I own a laptop and smartphones.  Later I was handed over to I.O (investigation Officer ) three people search my phones and Laptop for over four hours they even took it to their ICT but nothing incriminating was found. I thought I will be released that day since nothing was found on me untill they gave me  "Later I was handed over to an investigation officer, three people searched my phones and laptop for over four hours before the items were taken to their ICT but nothing incriminating was found. I thought I would be released that day since nothing was found on me until they gave me bail condition I couldn't meet up. I was asked to provide one lawyer, two sureties with houses in Ibadan and must be a taxpayer for at least two years. To make matters worse, the lawyer wanted to collect N200,000 for an offense I didn’t commit." Bail condition I couldn't meet up ( one lawyer, two surety with houses property in ibadan and must be a tax payer for at least 2 years ð) to make matter lawyer wanted to collect 200k for offense I know nothing about.  Rotimi further revealed that he was in the cell for two days where he had a very terrible experience. He also said the EFCC left his apartment open after he was arrested, allowing thieves to steal some of his belongings. "I met the bail condition on the third day and I was released but only for me to get home and find out that my apartment was ransacked. My television set was gone, every good appliance in my apartment was stolen including foodstuffs. "I thought there was Justice and human rights in this country, now I am back to square one, no thanks to EFCC," Rotimi added.  Before I forget my device is still with them because they are still doing their investigation on itð, I thought EFCC do their research before carrying out arrest, I thought there is Justice and human right in this country, now I am back to square one thanks to EFCC.
