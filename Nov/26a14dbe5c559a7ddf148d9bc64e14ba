3 Days Ago Biden had been neck to neck with incumbent President Donald Trump in what is being considered the tightest race in American history. Biden entered the race for the Democratic nomination as a frontrunner, having served in the Obama Administration that was most popular with the American people. Biden had suffered early setbacks in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary but seized control of the contest with a string of successes on Super Tuesday when 14 states voted on the nomination. Throughout his campaign, Biden preferred socially distant events as part of his efforts to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, which was the focal point of his race. He criticized Trump for hosting packed rallies which he described as “Super Spreader” events which violated every Coronavirus safety guideline. Biden’s core messaging focused on the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, equality, race relations, climate change and taxing the rich.
