Onochie had posted the picture on her Twitter page while urging Nigerians to ensure they wore face masks. She wrote, “Wearing a mask is not a political statement, it’s not punishment by the government. Protect yourself, wear one.

God bless their efforts.” WEARING A MASK IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT.
