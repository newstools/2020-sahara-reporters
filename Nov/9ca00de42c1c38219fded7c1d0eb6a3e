MARTIN BERNETTI AFP/File Pinera said he had accepted the resignation of Rozas, saying he shared the reasons and arguments the police boss had given for resigning. Police officers had on Wednesday shot and wounded two minors, aged 17 and 14, at a residence for troubled children and adolescents in the Southern city of Talcahuano. Police authorities claimed that the officers opened fire after they were attacked with sticks and stones at the center run by the National Service for Minors. Footage showed the adolescents writhing on the ground after they were shot in the legs. Children's Ombudsman, Patricia Munoz, denounced the police for using firearms in an absolutely unjustified and excessive manner.
