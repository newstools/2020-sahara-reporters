The West African Examinations Council has released the results of the 2020 Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination. WAEC had earlier delayed the release of the result due to widespread violence that engulfed the country after hoodlums hijacked the #EndSARS protest.  Students can now check their results for the exams, which took place between August 17, 2020, and Saturday, September 12.
