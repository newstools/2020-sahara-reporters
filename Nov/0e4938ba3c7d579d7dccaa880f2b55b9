Nurses in Ondo State under the employment of the government will from Tuesday (today) embark on a strike action over unpaid salaries, SaharaReporters has learnt. This comes a few days after resident doctors in the state embarked on indefinite strike action following the government's refusal to pay their four-month salary arrears.

One of the nurses, who identified herself as Adeola, told our correspondent that the non-payment of their salaries and deduction had made life difficult for them. She said, “We have been directed by the executive members that we too should begin a warning strike over the government's refusal to pay our salaries. "I have not received a salary for the past five months and I am working in the hospital every day. The most annoying aspect of it is that I am always on night duty. "So, we agreed to come to work but we won't work and that is the idea behind the work to rule strike that we are embarking upon for now.”
