"Because of the protest, Dangote ordered everybody to stop work. "As we were protesting this morning, someone was killed by the police. His body has been taken to the hospital," said one of the workers in a video obtained by SaharaReporters. The incident has led to unrest in the area as angry youth invaded the entrance of the company. They also started a bonfire while protesting the killing of the worker. The company said the workers were not directly employed by Dangote Refinery but through a contractor, Onshore. A spokesperson for Dangote Group said the workers were engaged by a contractor but the group has been working to ensure adequate compensation of workers and resolve the dispute. "Our attention has been drawn to an issue on social media alleging staff protest at the refinery over salary increment dispute. "The protesters are direct employees of Onshore, Offshore (Oil) and Chemie-Tech subcontractors, who are currently dealing with an industrial dispute with their employees. â€œThe situation is under control as we are mediating with the parties involved," Tony Chiejina, a spokesperson for the company said in a statement reacting to the incident.
