0 Comments
2 Weeks Ago Recall that the former FIRS boss was on November 2 invited for questioning by the EFCC over a N5bn fraud perpetrated in the agency under his watch. Earlier, nine senior officials of the agency were detained by the EFCC over alleged multi-billion naira fraud in 2019. Fowler was sacked by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019 after a query for worsening tax revenues since 2015. He was also accused of a lavish lifestyle, bankrolling extravagant parties and concerts in Lagos, poor corporate governance structures at the FIRS, poor audits at the FIRS, high handedness in office, diversion of funds, brazen corruption and awarding contracts to stooges and cronies. He was still being questioned at the Lagos office of the anti-graft agency as at the time of this report.
