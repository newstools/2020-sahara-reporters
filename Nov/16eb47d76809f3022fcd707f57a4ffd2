Reacting to the second part of the investigation, Mohammed while speaking on NTA on Wednesday morning said CNN was desperate and peddling fake news. He said, “It shows that they are desperate. The so-called recent development has been seen before. There is nothing new. If there is anything new, it is a contradiction of CNN’s position. “What we are asking CNN is that where is your evidence? The military has been consistent. CNN contravenes the basic principles of journalism – fairness, and balance. ‘They did the story without contacting the federal government for its own side. They relied on second and third parties narratives. “They (CNN) were caught spreading fake news and they are trying to escape. We are accusing them of basing their stories on videos sourced on social media. “CNN has been inconsistent. It also doctored the video it got. We are confident in our position.”
