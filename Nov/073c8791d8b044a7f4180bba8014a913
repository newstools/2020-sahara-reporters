4 Days Ago The duo had fled South Africa in a private jet belonging to Malawi’s President. South Africa says it has commenced extradiction processes against the preacher and his wife. Wapona Kita, lawyer to the Bushiri’s, asked the court to release the two unconditionally, saying their arrest had been illegal. The state prosecutor had asked the court to allow police to keep the couple in custody for a further 30 days to allow the South African Government to formally submit an extradition request. Kita said it was illegal to arrest them before South Africa made a formal extradition request.
