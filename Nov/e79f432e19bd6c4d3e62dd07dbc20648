Google The fresh kidnap case occurred on Owo-Ifon Road in Ose Local Government Area of the state around 7:00pm on Saturday. A member of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in the state, who identified himself as Mr Abiola, told SaharaReporters that the travellers were waylaid by the gunmen and marched into the bush. "This is a fresh case that I witnessed. I was on my way to Ifon when I saw the gunmen marching the travellers into the bush. "It was a terrifying scene for me, I was very scared when I saw them with guns. "At least, I saw about six of them marching into the forest and the gunmen dressed exactly like the Fulani. I am sure travellers were heading to Benin," he said. The police are yet to confirm the latest development.
