ChannelsTV Abang ordered all security agencies in the country to arrest Maina “wherever he may be found” and produce him in court, “without delay”. Lawyer of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mohammed Abubakar, while making the application, told the court that the former pension boss, who was granted bail in the sum of N500m with a surety in like sum, who must be a serving senator, had jumped bail. The court agreed with the EFCC that Maina’s absence from his trial on four successive dates was without a cogent or verifiable evidence. Recall that Maina spent over seven months on remand at Kuje Correctional Center before the court released him on bail after Senator Ndume agreed to stand surety for him.
