Ethiopia’s military has accused Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organisation, of siding with rebels led by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front as the country nears civil war. The WHO boss is of Tigrayan descent and served as Health Minister in a former government coalition led by the TPLF. Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Ethiopian Army Chief of Staff, General Birhanu Jula, in a televised address accused Dr Ghebreyesus of supporting and trying to procure arms and diplomatic support for Tigray. “This man is a member of that group and he has been doing everything to support them,” he said. A WHO spokesperson said no statement had been made yet by Ghebreyesus on the accusation levelled against him, Reuters report. Ethiopia is on the brink of civil war as the powerful regional party TPFL battles the central government over a conflict that started from disagreement on COVID-19 restrictions.
