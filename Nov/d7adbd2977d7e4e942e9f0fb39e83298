Nigerian Army An eyewitness, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said one of the soldiers shot into the air before the Keke rider was driven off in his tricycle. "As I was in the market buying something, soldiers ran in. I don't know what was pursuing them," the eyewitness said. "They ran and hit a Keke; the Keke boy did not do anything.

6 Days Ago Another resident of the town had last week informed SaharaReporters that soldiers had come into the same market to harass women who came out to sell. They repeatedly forced them to lie in a ditch, the source said. The resident also said a little child was shot in his compound, forcing the parents to abandon their house in fear. The army has, however, maintained that it has been professional in trying to retrieve weapons looted from its dead colleagues and arrest the attackers who committed the crime.
