A former presidential candidate, Kingsley Moghalu, has said the President Muhammadu Buhari government is not capable of protecting Nigerians. Reacting to the killing of 43 rice farmers in Borno State by Boko Haram insurgents, Moghalu in a series of tweets criticized the government and security agencies, accusing them of intimidating and arresting peaceful #EndSARS protesters demanding better governance but unable to arrest insurgents terrorizing the entire country.

"The barbaric beheading of 43 Nigerians in Zabarmari village in Borno State by Boko Haram is a national outrage and tragedy. It's increasingly clear that @NigeriaGov is unable to protect the lives of Nigerians. What does that mean? Our country is becoming a failed state," Moghalu said.

Our government & our @cenbank call peaceful citizens "financiers of terrorism" while the real terrorists are having a field day with Nigerian lives and no one apparently can stop them and their real financiers. It is a national shame! The real challenge we face: Can Nigeria survive until 2023 without a massive implosion? #NoSecurity #NoEconomy . What's left? #Restructuring
