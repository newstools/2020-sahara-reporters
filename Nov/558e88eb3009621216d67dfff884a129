Some workers of Egbin Power Plant in Lagos on Monday protested their poor working conditions and welfare packages. The workers accused the management of making life difficult for them.  Egbin Power Plc is the largest power generating station in Nigeria with an installed capacity of 1,320 megawatts consisting of six units each.  The station is located at Ijede/Egbin in Ikorodu.  Armed with placards with various inscriptions condemning the attitude of management towards workers, union leaders said they have decided to occupy the power plant until their demands were met.  They also alleged that there was no condition of service at the plant thereby subjecting workers to victimisation and arbitrary sack.
