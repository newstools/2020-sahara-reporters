Social media users from Northern Nigeria have lashed out at people of Niger Republic, accusing them of losing their faith and being on the verge of becoming infidels. An online Hausa medium, Damagaram Post of Niger Republic, published a picture of a lady from Damagaram participating in a beauty pageant in Niger.  In the photo, a girl identified as Maimouna Harouna was asked to be voted as ‘Miss Zinder’. The post, however, didn’t go down well with a number of Northern Muslims, some of whom quickly condemned and described the action as “haram”, an act forbidden under Islamic law. Recall that a  26-year-old Hausa actress, Rahama Sadau, was accused of stirring controversy and blasphemy after she shared some of her photos on social media wherein she wore a backless dress, which brought out her curves. The development generated controversy with several conservative Muslims lashing out at her for going against Islamic tenets of dressing. Reacting to the criticisms in a series of social media posts on Monday, Sadau said her fashion choice was not aimed at insulting Islam or Prophet Muhammad as alleged by some. An Islamic scholar, Lawal Gusau, also asked the Nigeria Police Force to arraign the  Kannywood actress before a Sharia court for her dressing.  See Also
