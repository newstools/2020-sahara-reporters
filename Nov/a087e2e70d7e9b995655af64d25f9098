The International Criminal Court has disclosed that it was conducting a preliminary investigation into the recent #EndSARS protests in Nigeria. In a statement, the office of the ICC prosecutor had earlier said it had received information on alleged crimes.  According to BBC, the examination will “assess whether the legal criteria for opening an investigation under the Rome Statute are met”. For weeks, crowds of peaceful protesters gathered in streets in major towns of Nigeria to demonstrate against police brutality, leading to a crackdown. Rights group, Amnesty International, said security forces opened fire on protesters, killing and injuring a number of people. Both the police and army have rejected Amnesty’s allegation. The ICC said it would make findings of the preliminary examination public.  See Also
