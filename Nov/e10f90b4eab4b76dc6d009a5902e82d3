1 Hour Ago During a 2018 thanksiginng in his honour in Toto Local Government Area of the state, Shekwo said killings around the country attributed to bandits and herdsmen were corruption fighting back and an attempt to discredit President Buhari. He said at the time, “If not because God in His infinite mercy decided to bring Buhari to power at the time He did, the country would have been in a serious mess by now. “The President is sincerely fighting corruption; corruption is responsible for all other reasons why there is so much rot in the system. “Boko Haram was also defeated and no local government area in the country today is under the control of the group as was the case in the past. “Immediately President Buhari started fighting corruption and corrupt people, every right-thinking Nigerian knew that corruption would fight back.”
