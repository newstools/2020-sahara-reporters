5 Hours Ago Commander of 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, Victoria Island, Lagos, Brigadier Gen. Ahmed Taiwo, who spoke while appearing before the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Saturday, said the claim was further than the truth. Taiwo also said the army can’t be bothered chasing one or two people, adding that there are "bigger fish to fry". He said, “Some people take delight in misrepresenting Nigeria and particularly the Nigerian Army to the international community and our fellow Nigerians. This, I believe is done for pecuniary gains. “Quite recently, a Nigerian, Catherine Udeh, also known as DJ Switch, claimed the Nigerian Army was looking for her. There is nothing further than the truth. “My Lord, we have bigger fish to fry." The Nigerian Army testifying on its involvement in the shooting and killing of peaceful #ENDSARS protesters claimed that the protest was hijacked by hoodlums and the military intervened to stop the killings of police officers as well as the looting and raping of citizens in the name of #EndSARS. He also confirmed a report by SaharaReporters that the military were drafted in by Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. See Also
