7 Hours Ago He will become the 46th President of the United States of America while Kamala Harris will become the first female and black person to become Vice President. Obama who campaigned massively for Biden, who once served side-by-side with him said, "I could not be prouder to congratulate our next President, Joe Biden, and our next First Lady, Jill Biden. "We're fortunate that Joe's got what it takes to be President and already carries himself that way. Because when he walks into the White House in January, he'll face a series of extraordinary challenges no incoming President ever has â€“ a raging pandemic, an unequal economy and justice system, a democracy at risk, and a climate in peril."
