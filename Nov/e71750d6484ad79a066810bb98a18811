The West Africa Examination Council on Thursday attributed the initial delay in the release of the 2020 Senior School Examination results of candidates in Ekiti to traffic on its portal. The examination body had on November 1 announced the release of results for the 2020 SSCE examination held nationwide.  Candidates sat for the exams between August 17 and September 12, 2020, due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Since Tuesday, many parents and their children had been disappointed over the non-release of the results. This led to anxiety on Wednesday when information filtered in that result for public schools candidates had been withheld by WEAC. Speaking with SaharaReporters, the Branch Controller of WEAC, Mr Olajide Hakeem, denied the allegations of indebtedness by the Ekiti State Government as the reason for the delay in the release of the results. He added that the examination body had written an "apology letter" to the Ekiti State Government through the Commissioner for Education over the delay in the release of the 2020 West Africa Senior School Examination results. According to him, the results have been released since Wednesday night for candidates in public schools in the state to assess their performance. One of the candidates, Tolulope Asaniyan, confirmed the release of the results, noting that the portal was now being able to be assessed.
