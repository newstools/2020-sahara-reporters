President Donald Trump's campaign said Wednesday that it had asked a court to stop the counting of votes in Michigan where rival Joe Biden holds a thin lead. According to AFP, Trump campaign manager, Bill Stepien, alleged without providing evidence that his team had not been allowed legally guaranteed access to observe vote counting in “numerous” locations.  Similarly, Trump’s campaign said it was demanding a recount in Wisconsin, a crucial state where early returns showed Biden with a slender lead. "There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties, which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results,” Stepien said in a statement. “The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately do so.” Wisconsin is one of a handful states where the fate of the US election now hangs in the balance.
