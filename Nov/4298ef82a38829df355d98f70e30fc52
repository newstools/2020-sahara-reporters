Justice Ayo Salami, Chair of the Judicial Commission, presenting the Report. #AsoVillaToday  Recall that the panel was inaugurated by President Buhari in July and was given 45 days to carry out the assignment but the timeframe was extended further after the panel requested more time. Magu's travail started after a memo by Abubakar Malami, Attorney-General of the Federation, accusing him of corruption. He was alleged to have mishandled the recovered loot and sold seized assets to his associates. Magu was also alleged to have purchased a property in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using a pastor as a conduit. He has since denied all the allegations, which he described as baseless.
