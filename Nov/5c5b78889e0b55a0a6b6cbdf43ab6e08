Both Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, still had paths to winning the White House by hitting the magic majority threshold of 270 of the electoral votes awarded to whichever candidate wins the popular vote in a given state. But momentum moved to Biden, who made a televised speech from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, saying that “when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.” By flipping the Northern battlegrounds of Michigan and Wisconsin, and also winning formerly pro-Trump Arizona, Biden reached 264 electoral votes against 214 so far for Trump. To reach 270, Biden hopes to add the six electoral votes from Nevada, where he had a small and shrinking lead, or even better, the larger prizes of hard-fought Georgia or Pennsylvania. However, Trump has so far accused his opponent of electoral fraud and threatened court action. See Also
