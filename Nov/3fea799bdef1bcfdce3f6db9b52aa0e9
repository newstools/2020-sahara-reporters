Nigerian have reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari's congratulatory message to Joe Biden, US president-elect. They took to social media to knock the President for lecturing Biden on democracy due to his government's lack of respect for citizens' rights.  Biden was projected as the winner of the 2020 presidential election after results from Pennsylvania meant his lead was now unassailable by President Donald Trump. According to Buhari, the former US vice president's election is a reminder that democracy is the best form of government. He said, "Congratulations to US President-Elect Joe Biden on his election at a time of uncertainty and fear in world affairs. His election is a reminder that democracy is the best form of government because it offers the people the opportunity to change their government by peaceful means.

We look forward to greater cooperation between Nigeria and the United States, especially at economic, diplomatic, political and security levels." In reaction, Nigerians took to Twitter to criticise the President. @AkOluwa; "I agree! Since we are talking about democracy and the will of the people, how have you fared in respecting the will of the people? How have you respected freedom of peaceful assembly and association? Have you even read the constitution of the country you lead?." I absolutely agree! Since we are talking about democracy and the will of the people, how have you fared in respecting the will of the people? How have you respected freedom of peaceful assembly and association? Have you even read the constitution of the country you lead?  @dandyned; "Will of the people? Yet peaceful protesters are being arrested and their accounts frozen, we're yet to know what exactly their crimes are. Is this a democracy coz the actions of this government towards the common citizens (your countrymen) does not depict democracy?"
