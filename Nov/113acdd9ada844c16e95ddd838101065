Tunde Bakare, the Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, has condemned the freezing of bank accounts of #EndSARS protesters and promoters by the Central Bank of Nigeria. Bakare while speaking during Sunday service at his church said actions taken by the Nigerian Government to quell the protest must be reversed. Tunde Bakare He said, “Some of the actions recently taken by the government on the heels of the #EndSARS protests may need to be reversed sooner rather than later in our collective interest so that they do not trigger further protests. “Among such policy actions is the freezing of the accounts of young Nigerians who reportedly sponsored the protests. While I admit that, under our extant laws, banks may freeze an account upon an ex parte order granted to a law enforcement agency by a court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of an investigation, these provisions of our Law should not be used to intimidate Nigerian youth simply because they engaged in and promoted protests against the inactions of government. “Targeting and arresting citizens on trumped-up charges, deploying court probes as a tool of intimidation, and generally eroding our fragile peace, are deeply worrisome signs of regression. “To extend the olive branch to the youth in one breath and to deprive the youth of the right to freedom of movement and property as enshrined in our constitution in another breath, will send confusing signals and cast doubts in their minds regarding the sincerity of the government.” He also condemned the call by some members of the political class for regulation of social media in the country. He said, “Any political group that takes the social media-savvy Nigerian youth for granted does so at its own risk or peril. “This is why I strongly advise the power blocs, including the South-West governors who are calling for stricter regulation of social media to desist from doing so.”
