A member representing Zango/Jaba Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, Amos Gwamna Magaji, has condemned in strong terms the killings of the District Head of Gidan Zaki and his son in Atyap Chiefdom, Zango Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Magaji, in a statement, described the murders which occurred during the early hours of Tuesday as evil and a violation of the sanctity of human lives.  He lamented that the killings happened at a time the state government and relevant stakeholders were making an effort to ensure peace in the area following attacks on communities which left scores of people dead and properties destroyed. The lawmaker said the murders were a deliberate attempt by mischief makers to disrupt the relative peace process that the ethnic groups in the area had initiated. Magaji condoled with the Atyap traditional council and the family of the deceased, praying to God for the repose of their souls.
