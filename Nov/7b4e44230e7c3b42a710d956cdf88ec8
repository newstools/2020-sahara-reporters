The Lagos State Police Command has confirmed the death of a 19-year-old boy, Maduabuchi Okeke, who died during a sex romp at a hotel in the Surulere area of the state. According to the police report, Okeke "died on top of one Sandra," a commercial sex worker at the Exclusive Mansion Hotel on Ayilara Street in the area.

According to the police investigation, the corpse was kept in a vehicle and placed on one Ejike Naso'sNaso's leg who was asked to take the deceased to the hospital as if he was only unconscious.
