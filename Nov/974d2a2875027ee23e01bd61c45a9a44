On Saturday, Kamala Devi Harris made history by becoming the first female vice president-elect of the United States of America as well as the first black person to occupy that office ever. Harris ran with the Democratic candidate and the former US vice president, Joe Biden, defeating incumbent President Donald Trump in what is viewed as the tightest race in US election history.  The 56-year old was elected to the US Senate under the Democratic ticket in 2016 to represent California. With her Senate victory, Harris became the first Indian-American to serve as a U senator as well as the second African American woman to hold that position. But as many in the nation celebrated Biden and Harris' projected to win, another question quickly arose: what will the world call her husband? Second Man? Second Husband or Vice Spouse? No doubt, Doug Emhoff has also made history by becoming the first male spouse of a vice president in the US. According to Wikipedia, Emhoff was born to Jewish parents, Michael and Barbara Emhoff, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on October 13, 1964. He lived in New Jersey from 1969 to 1981, moving with his family to California when he was a teenager. Emhoff graduated from Agoura High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from California State University, Northridge and a Juris Doctor from the USC Gould School of Law. He is a California-based attorney and partner of DLA Piper in Los Angeles. He is currently on a leave of absence, according to the firm's website. Emhoff was married for 16 years to Kerstin Emhoff. They have two children, Cole and Ella. He married Kamala on August 22, 2014, in Santa Barbara, California, with Kamala's sister Maya Harris officiating. As of August 2019, Emhoff and Harris had an estimated net worth of $5.8 million. Come January 20, 2021, he will become the first Jewish spouse to a US vice president.
