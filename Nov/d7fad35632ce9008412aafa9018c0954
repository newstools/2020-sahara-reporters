Nigerians have reacted to news of the United Arab Emirates approving the issuance of a 10-year golden visa for more professionals including PhD holders, physicians, engineers as well as graduates from certain universities in a bid to keep the “talented people and great minds” in the Gulf country and help in nation-building. Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in a series of tweets on Sunday said the golden visa also extends to spouses of beneficiaries and their children.  He said, “We approved granting the 10-year Golden visa to all PhD holders in the UAE. Also, the Golden visa will be granted to top graduates from UAE-accredited universities with a GPA of 3.8 and above.  Today, we approved granting the 10-year Golden Visa to all PhD holders in the UAE. Also, the Golden Visa will be granted to top graduates from UAE-accredited universities with a GPA of 3.8 and above.   UAE Golden Visa will also include UAE-based physicians as well as engineers in the fields of computer science, electronics, programming, electricity and biotechnology.   Other categories granted UAE Golden Residency are specialists in AI, big data, virology, epidemiology & UAEâs high school top graduates and their families. We are keen to embrace talent that drives future development and this is only the beginning.  While reacting on Twitter, @AdelakunTufayi said, “As a Nigerian this has attracted me to UAE.
