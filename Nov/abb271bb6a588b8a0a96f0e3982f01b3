Doris Ididia, sister of a victim of police brutality, has narrated how the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad ( SARS ) tortured and starved her brother for three days before he passed away. She accused one Inspector Kingsley of orchestrating the operation in October 2016 which left her brother, Festus Idehen, with various degrees of injuries before he eventually died.  Ididia burst into tears while narrating how the police killed her brother before the independent investigative panel in Abuja on Wednesday. She told the panel that her brother was beaten to stupor by the mob and that the officer rejected efforts to avail him with medical treatment. The deceased was said to have bought a car from his brother-in-law, Onyekachi, which police claimed was a stolen car. She explained that Idehen received a phone call on October 3, 2016, and he drove in his car to meet the caller but was trailed from behind by the operatives who arrested him. She said that his brother was portrayed as a thief before a mob descended on him and dehumanised him with beating. She said that her brother was later taken to SARS detention centre in Abuja but only taken to the hospital when police discovered that he was almost dead. The family members of the victim, through their lawyer, have demanded N200 million compensation for the death of Festus Idehen and for the trauma the family has gone through over his untimely death. The panel adjourned the matter to December 15, 2020, for cross-examination of the complainant and continuation of hearing.
