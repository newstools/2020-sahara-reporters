The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Monday, warned political office holders and policymakers against paying lip service to youth unemployment. He challenged his colleagues in positions of authorities to factor youth employment and empowerment into the 2021 budget to escape another round of #EndSARS protests. Ahmad Lawan Lawan gave the warning when the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Sabo Nanono, led top officials of his ministry to defend its 2021 budget before the Senate Committee on Agriculture. The Senate President said, "Recently, we had protests by some of our youths. Some of them, very genuine, were seeking the attention of leaders and they got the attention. "So, our budget, especially for 2021, should be mindful of what we do to provide employment opportunities for these youths. "They demonstrated, they protested because they could do so. There are so many other people who may not be youthful but are also in the same need. They didn't protest. "Let us meet them where they are; we don't want to wait until they also start to grumble or protest. We should be proactive." Lawan said the oil sector and the white-collar jobs could no longer provide the required employees to keep the youths busy and financially stable.
