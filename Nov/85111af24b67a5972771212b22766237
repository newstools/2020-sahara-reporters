Judge Refuses To Issue Release Order Of Woman After State Withdraws From Prosecuting Her
0 Comments
3 Days Ago Despite the Lagos Government withdrawing the case, Justice Nwaka-Gbagi has continued to keep Ekaete in prison by not issuing a release order for her. The judge has absented herself from presiding on the case three times after prosecution was withdrawn by the government. When the case was to come up for hearing on Monday (today), the registrar informed the court that the judge was absent. The judge adjourned the matter indefinitely with no definite date given for the resumption of the case. "It is unfortunate the judge did not sit on the matter today and no return date was given. "The counsel for the state was not present and the defendant was not produced today. "However, that should not be the reason why the judge should refuse to make the order of discharge in view of the fact the state has officially informed the court that it was no longer pressing any charge against the defendant," Ekaete's lawyer said. The lawyer urged the judge to grant the release of Ekaete, noting that she needed medical care and to attend to the needs of her two children.
