A policeman attached to the convoy of Speaker of Nigeria's House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila,  has allegedly shot dead a newspaper vendor named Elechi Emmanuel at the Federal Secretariat in Abuja. The victim was seen gasping for breath and unconscious in a video obtained by SaharaReporters while one of his colleagues tried desperately to revive him immediately after the shooting.  It was gathered that newspaper vendors upon sighting the Speaker's convoy gathered to hail him but the overzealous security detail opened fire on them, killing Emmanuel in the process.
