Nyesom Wike, Governor of Rivers State, has visited the house of former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Joy Nunieh, to "rescue" her after the place was surrounded by policemen, who barred her from leaving home this morning. Wike forced entry into Nunieh's house and ordered the police officers out of the premises.  He drove off with her in his convoy shortly afterward.
