The All Progressives Congress candidate for the September 19, 2020 governorship election in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, on Tuesday appeared in court in a case preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Ize-Iyamu is being tried on an eight-count charge of money laundering to the tune of N700m reportedly deployed to prosecute the 2015 general elections. Upon resumption of hearing, counsel to EFCC, Ahmed Arogha, appealed to the court for more time to respond to the objection motion raised by counsel to the five defendants bordering on the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter. The presiding judge, Justice Mohammed Umar, granted the request of the EFCC counsel by giving him seven days to respond. Justice Umar also gave the defendantsâ€™ counsels seven days to also respond to the submission of the counsel to the EFCC and subsequently adjourned the matter until October 15, 2020 for continuation of hearing. The four other defendants in the suit include former Edo State Peoples Democratic Party Chairman, Dan Orbih; Tony Aziegbemi; former deputy governor of Edo State, Lucky Imasuen, and Efe Erimuoghae-Anthony.
