Gunmen suspected to be sponsored by the Kogi State Government on Wednesday attacked staff of the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja. SaharaReporters gathered that the staff were planning a press conference to pressure the Federal Government into establishing a COVID-19 screening centre in the state when the incident took place. It was learnt that the gunmen shot sporadically into the air to scare people away, then went to the records and admin department where they seized laptops and destroyed a few things. They ransacked the Medical Directorâ€™s office, too. Speaking at a prayer session for the late Nasir Ajana, Kogi Chief Judge, on Tuesday, Governor Yahaya Bello had said COVID-19 was created to shorten the lifestyle of the people. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has so far announced three cases of COVID-19 in Kogi but the state government has insisted that the state was free of the disease.
