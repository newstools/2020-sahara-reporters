Supporters of human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, has called on the National Human Rights Commission to live up to its responsibility and prevail on the Nigerian Government to allow him move around as a free man. The supporters defied the heavy downpour by making their ways to the commission to condemn the delay tactics employed by the government to frustrate the trial of the activist in order to keep him on in Abuja where he had been since being released on bail in December 2019. Speaking on behalf of the group, Sydney Usman said the refusal of the courts to hear the suits of the activist pending before them was tantamount to subversion of justice.  See Also

5 Hours Ago  He said, “We are here to register our anger over the way the Nigerian Government has continued to delay Sowore’s case in the court. "The suit on the enforcement of fundamental rights was listed in number 6&7 as (Bakare Vs DSS, AGF) and Sowore Vs DSS, AGF) at Federal High Court today but we were told that the matter will not be heard without being given any reason. "We cannot accept this injustice anymore. Sowore is being kept in the 'city prison'. You did not allow him to see his wife and children. This is a democratic society not military regime.” A representative of the commission, Fatimah Agwai Mohammed, who attended to the protesters, said the organisation had been on the matter and promised to look into the complaints of the demonstrators. She asked the protesters to avail the commission a formal complaint for the purpose of documentation.
