The Government of the United Kingdom has banned all service providers in the country from buying new Huawei 5G equipment over national security concerns. Oliver Dowden, the UK's Digital Secretary, told the House of Commons of the decision on Tuesday, the BBC reports. The service providers must also remove all the Chinese firm's 5G kit from their networks by 2027 under the new regulations.
