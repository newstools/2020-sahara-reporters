Before July 10, 2020, not so many Nigerians and indeed others around the world had the slightest knowledge of the enormous wealth at the disposal of Nigeria’s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria. A little known lawyer from Kebbi State before 2015 when he was appointed into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, the 53-year-old is today one of the richest men in Nigeria, thanks to the great power vested in his office and the influence he commands and peddles in Nigeria’s top circles.

The online news medium in one of its reports revealed how one of Malami’s sons with no known history of employment owns a N3bn property in Birnin Kebbi, capital of Kebbi State, known as "AZBIR Arena."

On his own, Malami was discovered to have built a multi-billion naira private school in Kebbi, a luxury hotel in Kano, and a luxury home in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. The AGF was discovered to have three houses in Abuja including one he bought this year for N90m in the Gwarimpa area of the city where he lives. He is said to have torn down the building and remodelled into a mansion worth around N300m.   Also in Abuja, he is alleged to own a multi-million naira hotel still under construction along Jabi Lake Bypass directly opposite the Pedestals Bridge close to Setraco main office.  New Multi-billion Naira Hotel Reportedly Owned By AGF Malami Under Construction In Jabi   Malami, according to findings by SaharaReporters, is also allegedly building a massive structure in Sokoto State. This is in addition to several other properties he owns across Nigeria and expensive cars to his name. During the wedding ceremony of one of his sons, Abdulaziz, last weekend, the jet-setting lifestyle of Malami and his family members came to full glare.

Persons close to the AGF told SaharaReporters that since being appointed into the government of President Muhammadu Buhari in November 2015, Malami had embarked on a relentless purchase and construction of property through alleged public funds. Despite the open display of unexplained wealth by the AGF and members of his family in recent times, President Buhari, who rode to power in 2015 on the back of a promise to crush corruption especially in government circle, is yet to offer any statement on the development. Nigeria's President is known to condone corruption amongst members of his inner circle and this is evident in the deployment of a Presidential aircraft -- Dassault Falcon 900 with registration number NAF 961 -- for the wedding of Malami's son.   Observers say Buhari’s silence is an endorsement of the atrocities of one of his most trusted lieutenants – Malami.
