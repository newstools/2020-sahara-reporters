According to HumAngle newspaper, the six minutes and five seconds video shows fully armed fighters speaking in Hausa, English and Kanuri. “Special greetings from your jihadi brethren in the Lake Chad Basin.

Repent, you still have time. And if you don’t, wait and see what will happen to you very soon,” he said. HumAngle further revealed that other speakers in English and Kanuri emphasised the same message in different languages. “My message to Kuffar (unbelievers). O’Kuffar, you have time to repent to Allah before Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala punishes you with our hands,” the English speaker warned. “Soon you will see what is happening in your marketplaces. Soon you’ll see what is happening in your offices. “Soon you’ll see what is happening in your homes. Anywhere you are, soon you’ll see what is happening.” Another terrorist promised to track down whoever the Nigerian Army sent for an undercover operation in their midst.
