He explained that anytime he wanted to go for the operation, the herbalist would instruct him to kneel down in front of him and he (Ajani) would make some incantations and then put something on his tongue three times.The suspect said whenever he located his victims, he would hit them with the shovel and when they laid in a pool of their blood, he would make some incantations and move around the body three times and then back it for about five minutes with his eyes closed before leaving the scene.He added that after the operation, he would return to the herbalist, who would make some incantations again, buy food for him and give him N500. When asked the reasons for the killings, Sodipe said he didn’t know as it was the herbalist, who was just sending him on such errands.
