The United States Government has reversed its plan to deport international students in the country, who are taking courses online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reversal in the decision comes one week after the initial policy was announced and follows a lawsuit instituted by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology against the US Government. District Judge, Allison Burroughs, in Massachusetts says the parties have come to a settlement, BBC reports. Nigerian students in America told SaharaReporters they were concerned about the initial plans, which would have seen them deported to Nigeria. The students will now be allowed to stay in the US and continue their studies.
