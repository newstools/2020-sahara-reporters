The Joint Task Force of the Kogi State Vigilante Service and Neighbourhood Watch has foiled a kidnap operation along Lokoja-Abuja Road in the early hours of Tuesday, leading to the death of one the miscreants. The kidnappers returned to the same spot at about 11:00pm for the same operation barely 24 hours after two of them were killed on Monday by the task force. The task force was said to have confronted the criminals in the operation and killed one of them while others escaped. SaharaReportersÂ gathered that the team has launched a manhunt for the fleeing criminals. The bandits had recently laid siege to the road and unleashed terror on travellers, leading to the deaths of many people.
