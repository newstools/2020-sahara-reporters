Nigerian Air Force's first female combat helicopter pilot, Tolulope Arotile, has died in a road accident. SaharaReporters gathered that Arotile sustained head injuries from a road accident which occurred at the NAF Base in Kaduna on Tuesday. She made history on October 15, 2019, when she was commissioned as the first combat helicopter pilot in the Air Force following the completion of her course at the Starlite International Training Academy, South Africa. NAF, in a statement, said she died on Tuesday. The statement quoted the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, as describing her death as an "irreparable loss". It partly read, "It is with great sorrow that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) regretfully announces the unfortunate demise of Flying Officer Tolulope Arotile. "She died today, July 14 2020, as a result of head injuries sustained from a road traffic accident at NAF Base Kaduna. "Until her death, â€ªFlying Officer Arotile, who was commissioned into the NAF in September 2017 as a member of Nigerian Defence Academy Regular Course 64, was the first-ever female combat helicopter pilot in the service. "During her short but impactful stay in the service, late Arotile, who hailed from Iffe in Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State, contributed significantly to the efforts to rid the North Central states of armed bandits and other criminal elements by flying several combat missions under Operation GAMA AIKI in Minna, Niger State. "The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, on behalf of officers, airmen, airwomen and civilian staff of the NAF, commiserates with the family of late Arotile over this irreparable loss. "We pray that the Almighty God grants her soul eternal rest," NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said in the statement.
