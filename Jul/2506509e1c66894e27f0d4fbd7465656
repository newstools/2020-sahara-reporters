In his reaction to the unfolding drama, which include attacks and counter attacks between and around persons, institutions, and the Niger Delta Development Commission, President Buhari expressed his strong determination to get to the root of the problem undermining the development of the Niger Delta and its peoples in spite of enormous national resources voted year after year for this singular purpose. In a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Thursday, Buhari said auditing firms and investigative agencies working in collaboration with National Assembly committees to resolve the challenges in the NDDC must initiate actions in a time-bound manner and duly inform the Presidency of the actions being taken.
