The High Court of Justice in Kaduna State will hear the motion put forward by Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, asking for the dismissal of the case against him by the Nigerian Government over its failure to produce evidence on July 30. El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, have been detained by the Nigerian Government since 2015 after hundreds of his followers were killed by the Nigerian Army in Zaria, Kaduna State. Femi Falana (SAN), had asked the court to quash the charges preferred against El-Zakzaky by the Nigerian Government for not “disclosing an offence known to law contrary to Section 36 (8) and (12) of the 1999 constitution as amended”. In the hearing notice seen by SaharaReporters on Thursday, the court asked both parties to bring evidence supporting “his own case or contradicting that of the opponent”. Ibraheem-El-Zakzaky
