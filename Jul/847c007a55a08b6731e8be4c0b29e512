Dozens of supporters of human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, on Wednesday in Abuja besieged the headquarters ofthe Court of Appeal and Federal High Court to protest the delay in his trial. The protesters demanded the withdrawal of the trumped-up charges against the activist. They gathered at the main gate of the Court of Appeal before proceeding to the Federal High Court located in Maitama alongside the activist to register their displeasure at the slow pace of his trial. A protester, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said the government resorted to delay tactics because they did not have evidence against the activist.
