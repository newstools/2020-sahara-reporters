SaharaReporters' lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), has asked Nigeria's Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to hands off the petition against media organisation by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), so that the court can adequately determine the case. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria made the demand on Monday in a letter to the IGP titled; "Re: Publication of Malicious Libel and Criminal Defamation Against Mr Abubakar Malami by SaharaReporters Inc". Falana said the AGF had earlier threatened SaharaReporters with a libel lawsuit if the media house failed to retract its publications against him within seven days.  The lawyer said since the AGF had decided on a lawsuit, his petition to the IGP had become "needless" and "gratuitous".
