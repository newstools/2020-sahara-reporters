Concerned Nigerians, a pro-democracy and human rights group, has expressed shock over the death of United States foremost civil rights activist and congressman, John Lewis. The activist died after a six-month battle with cancer at the age of 80. Lewis in December 2019 was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which was discovered as a result of a routine medical visit and subsequent testing.  The convener of Concerned Nigerians group, Deji Adeyanju, while reacting to the news of the demise of Lewis, said the civil rights activist lived an exemplary life worthy of emulation. He said, “John Lewis was a courageous activist and one who stood steadfastly in defense of democracy and rights of people, especially the  people of color in America. He will be greatly missed.
