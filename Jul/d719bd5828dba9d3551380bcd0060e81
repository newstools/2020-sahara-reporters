Ibrahim Magu, EFCC Chair, was arrested Monday in Abuja. The Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, accused Magu of “insubordination and re-looting of recovered funds.” The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was established in 2003. All the chairpersons have been Muslim Fulani and police officers: Nuhu Ribadu (2003-2007), Ibrahim Lamorde (2008), Farida Mzamber Waziri ( 2008-2011), Ibrahim Lamorde (2011-2015), and Ibrahim Magu (2015-present). President Muhammadu Buhari’s presidency is reputed for nepotism. Buhari’s open display of ethnic bias and favouritism is unrivaled in the history of Nigeria. Under Buhari, Nigerians are treated unequally in many respects, particularly when it comes to revenue allocation and political representation. Buhari has resolved to Fulanised all federal civil service and federal agencies. Nepotism breeds resentment. It breeds corruption. It weakens the ability of the federal government to function efficiently and effectively. It is anti-developmental. 

Bayo Oluwasanmi Nepotism causes aggravating socioeconomic crises in Nigeria. Buhari’s ethnic bias and favoritism violate the principle of federal character fairness, equality, and justice. Ethnic bias and favoritism are major causes of resentment and rebellion among the marginalized ethnic groups. It fuels conflicts and retarded development in the country. Because of nepotism, federal contracts are being awarded to unqualified bidders who are in cahoots with relatives of Buhari and cronies. Buhari has established important government-funded projects in arbitrarily selected areas of his home state of Katsina, even where the projects are not cost-ineffective. It’s no surprise that Fulanis heavily dependent on federal government patronage. The disadvantages of nepotism notwithstanding, that will not deter Buhari from appointing another Muslim Fulani police officer as the next chairperson of EFCC. Remember, Buhari belongs to no one but the Fulanis. If Magu was removed, another Muslim police Fulani should be appointed as EFCC chairperson. This will ensure the all Muslim Fulani federal civil service and federal agencies are not polluted with “infidels” or “outsiders.” The Fulani purity must be maintained at all times. After all, the other ethnic groups are invisible, incompetent, uneducated, corrupt, dumb, retarded, unpolished, unqualified, and non-career police officers to head EFCC.Here’s what I mean: 1.
