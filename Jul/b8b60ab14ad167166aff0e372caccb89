From January to July 2020, at least 178 persons were killed in local government areas of Southern Kaduna, data from Civic Media Lab’s life count and media report of killings gathered by SaharaReporters show. Gunmen of Fulani ethnicity reportedly perpetrated most of the attacks. Reports say 207 arrests were made last week.  The figure (178) was calculated based on media reports. Some of the deaths were unreported, implying the figure is higher. For instance, Human rights group, Inter-Society, reckons that 300 persons were killed in southern Kaduna between January 1 and July 20, 2020. The organisation said 152 of the murders were recorded in Kajuru local government alone. In writing this report, Sahara Reporters defined southern Kaduna to mean the local governments of Kajuru, Kachia, Zangon-Kataf, Kaura, Kagarko, Jaba, Jema‘a, Sanga and Kajuru. From January to June 2020, CML’s findings indicate that there were 83 deaths across the local governments listed. Most of them happened in Kajuru, home to the Adara ethnic group.
