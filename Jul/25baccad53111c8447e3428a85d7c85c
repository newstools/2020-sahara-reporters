A group, Kebbi Concerned Citizens, has asked the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to clear himself from allegations of corruption and save Kebbi State from national embarrassment. KCC in a statement on Tuesday also issued a seven-day ultimatum to Malami to debunk the series of allegations of corruption, misconduct and abuse of office by SaharaReporters. The statement reads, “KCC watched with keen interest following media face off and series of allegations of corruption, misconduct and abuse of office by online media outfit SaharaReporters and revelations coming from the Presidential panel probing Ibrahim Magu of the EFCC. 

AGF Malami “The allegations raised are too heavy to ignore considering the position Malami is occupying as the chief law officer of the federation and as a representative of Kebbi State in the Federal Executive Council. “Therefore, KCC wishes to use this opportunity to call on the AGF to clear himself from the allegations within seven days to save his name, image and integrity as well as the reputation of the state or risk call for the President and the National Assembly to set panels of investigation of the matter.” In a series of text and photo stories in recent days, SaharaReporters had exposed how Malami, who was a little known lawyer before being appointed into the government of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, had maintained an opulent lifestyle fuelled by public funds despite displaying a saintly posture before the public.
