It said it was working on improving response time across steep terrain, increasing the number of troops in the area and expecting support from the Air Force.

The security officials “confirmed that a cycle of attacks and reprisals was compounding criminal activities in the area and causing needless loss of lives and appealed to all sides to embrace peace.” Okonkwo told the meeting that he had received a deployment of Special Forces.

In his opening remarks, Governor El-Rufai said he came to the meeting “with a heavy heart, saddened by the needless pain several of our communities are enduring in the cycle of violence that is recurring in parts of our state.
