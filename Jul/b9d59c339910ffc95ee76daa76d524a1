The Nigerian Air Force has said that the police would take over the trial of classmates of late Tolulope Arotile, who knocked her down with a vehicle. NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, made the disclosure while briefing the public on the outcome of preliminary investigation of Arotile’s death. NAF had earlier said the driver of the vehicle, Mr Nehemiah Adejo, did not have a valid driver’s license.  Daramola said the case was a civil matter and would, therefore, be handed over to the police with the hope of charging the suspects to court. He said, “Being a civil case, the matter will be handed over to the Nigeria Police with a view to further investigating and charging the suspects to court in accordance with extant laws.” The death of Arotile led to a public outcry with Nigerians calling for an investigation into her demise.
