Your Excellency, Please sir, I will like to seek your kind clarification on a burning issue on behalf of other Lagosians. Is Epe still part of Lagos State? If it is sir, why has the road leading to Epe from Lagos been abandoned?  The toll gate at Admiralty Circle Plaza is meant to service the Eti-Osa/Epe Expressway sir. We have been paying toll on that road since 2011 but it is like hell to travel from Lagos to Epe presently. It used to be a 30-minute journey from Ajah sir but now it is totally a mess. Please take up this matter and help us with the reconstruction of that road sir, so as to decongest the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and give the people of Eti-Osa, Ibeju-Lekki and Epe, a sense of belonging. The bulk of the IGR of Lagos State comes from Eti-Osa but it is the local government that is starved of infrastructure in the state. God bless you for your anticipated prompt response and action sir. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN Lekki, Lagos. 02/07/2020
