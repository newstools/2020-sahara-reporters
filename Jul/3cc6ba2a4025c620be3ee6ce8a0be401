Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo State, tested positive for Coronavirus two weeks before announcing it to the public, SaharaReporters has discovered. Akeredolu had on June 30 announced his COVID-19 status on his Facebook page, making the public believe he just discovered the news at the time. But SaharaReporters on Tuesday gathered that the governor became aware of his status three weeks ago but refused to disclose it for political reasons. Akeredolu and the late Commissioner for Health in Ondo, Wahaab Adegbenro, both tested positive for the virus at the same time and were on drugs without the knowledge of the public until the latter died. 

Ondo Governor Rotimi Akeredolu During that period, the Ondo State governor had close physical contact with several government officials including aides and other persons in the All Progressives Congress 'family', thereby exposing them to the deadly virus. “Governor Rotimi Akeredolu has been positive for a long time, it was when he realised he will soon test negative that he came out to say he had the virus. “Same thing with the Commissioner for Health that died. Despite the fact that he tested positive for the virus, he was still moving about and treating himself,” a senior health worker close to both officials made the disclosure on Tuesday. Governor Akeredolu had during a press briefing on Monday declared that doctors had certified him free of the deadly virus after he tested negative for COVID-19 twice. His announcement came shortly after deputy governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi, gave him an ultimatum to hand over power due to his poor health.

1 Day Ago Ajayi, who recently left the APC to join the Peoples Democratic Party in the state ahead of the October 10 governorship election, threatened to explore all legal means to take over leadership of Ondo while Akeredolu remained ill. According to observers, that situation forced Governor Akeredolu to announce his recovery from the virus on Monday, less than 14 days after he first opened up on his status.

2 Days Ago Going by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control guidelines, an infected person is placed under strict observance for at least 14 days after which tests will reveal if the individual had made a recovery or not. The announcement by Akeredolu therefore confirms the fact that he knew his status long before making it public. As a result of the latest development, it is now suspected that the governor's wife, Betty, may also have contracted Coronavirus long before it was made public and perhaps also exposed other unsuspecting persons to the virus.
