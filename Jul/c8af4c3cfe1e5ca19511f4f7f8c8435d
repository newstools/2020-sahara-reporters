The Founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, Aare Afe Babalola, on Wednesday, recommended an amendment to the laws relating to rape to prescribe outright castration to serve as a deterrent. Babalola also called on the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency on rape matters.  The university founder said, “Castrating perpetrators of rape cannot be said to be too much, bearing in mind the physical, psychological and emotional pains they inflict on their victims and families.” The ABUAD founder, in a statement by the Head, Corporate Affairs of the institution, Tunde Olofintila, stated, “The prevalence of rape cases is not only alarming but also worrisome. It is worrisome in the sense that it is inconceivable that a male could forcibly rape someone and goes further to kill her.” He blamed the frequent cases of rape and murder on the use of drugs, poverty and rituals. The elder statesman said, “Society would recover from the scourge of rape through constant vigilance, observance of the religious tenet of being our brothers (and sisters) keepers, provision of employment and avoidance of drug as well as a timely end of the ravaging COVID-19.” Babalola, who recalled the cases of the 22-year-old Vera Omozuwa, a student of the University of Benin, and 19-year- old Barakat Bello, a student of the Institute of Agriculture, Research and Training, Ibadan, who were raped and murdered, said, “The society cannot afford to fold its arms and watch the alarming and worrisome situation to continue unchecked."
