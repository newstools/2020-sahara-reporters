Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, has denied comments attributed to him condemning the cancellation of the 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examinations. A report trending on social media alleged that he attacked President Muhammadu Buhari, saying nothing seems to be right under his administration. “Examination cannot hold because Coronavirus is a grave danger to students but elections can hold because it is an agenda to politicians. 


BBC “Nothing seems to be right under Buhari,” part of the comments attributed to Prof Soyinka read. But the literary icon on Tuesday denied making such comments during a brief interaction with our correspondent. He described the news as fake and not coming from him. The Nigerian Government had announced on July 6 that schools across the country could resume in order to allow students participate in the WASSCE scheduled to commence on August 4, 2020. However, on July 8, Adamu Adamu, Minister of Education, announced a reversal of the decision to reopen schools and exempted students in Federal Government colleges from participating in the examination.
