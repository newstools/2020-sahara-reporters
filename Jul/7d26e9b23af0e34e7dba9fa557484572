Afri-Goal Foundation has asked Governor Nasir El-Rufai to find a lasting solution to the incessant killings in Southern Kaduna. In a statement condemning the killings, the group also berated Governor El-Rufai for making unfounded statements about the massacre in the state. The group noted that  El-Rufai had failed in his constitutional duty to protect the lives and property of the people.  "The unchecked killings have continued for long with Governor El-Rufai looking the other way. "This is baffling, as it is an act directly contrary to the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) that tasked the governor, who is the chief security officer of the state, to protect the lives and property of those in the state, regardless of their religious beliefs, tribe or tradition. "Governor El-Rufai has failed in doing this. He should either find a lasting solution or resign if he is unfit to carry out his primary constitutional duty. "The latest of the killings in Southern Kaduna came on Sunday while a curfew was in place," the statement noted. The group also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the police and relevant security agencies to find a lasting solution to killings in other parts of the country. "Afri-Goal has also heard Governor El-Rufai make spurious statements while speaking on the killings in the state. "A democratically elected governor should not make this statement. We demand the governor to apologise to the people of Southern Kaduna and immediately direct the police, who are to provide internal security, to ensure there is no more wanton killing in the part of the state. "Afri-Goal also calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately move to stop the killings in Southern Kaduna and other parts of the country where bandits and gunmen have free and unchecked killings. "The life of every Nigerians should be dear to all political leaders," the group said.
