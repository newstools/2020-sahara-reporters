Boko Haram terrorists have asked a 75-year-old visually impaired man living in an internally displaced persons camp in Borno State to pay N20m as ransom for his abducted daughter and niece. Jato Ndarfa, who fled from Gwoza in 2014 after Boko Haram terrorists invaded his village, killing more than 100 people and is now taking refuge at the CAN Center IDP Camp in Maiduguri, asked the Nigerian Government to intervene and ensure the release of members of his family. He said the terrorists made contact through his niece's phone. Ndarfa said his daughter is Lami Jato, a 25-year-old graduate of Sir Kashim Ibrahim College of Education, and his niece is Renita Bitrus. Both were abducted by the terrorists while on a farm at Tungushe Village in the Magumeri Local Government Area of Borno State. He said, “It was two of them; my daughter, Lami Jato and my niece, Renita Bitrus, who is married with two children; that were abducted by the Boko Haram terrorists. “It is 15 days now since they were abducted when they went to the farm in Tungushe along the Maiduguri-Monguno Road. “Initially, they were seven in number at the farm where they were abducted but the terrorists later released four of the men and held one male, the tractor driver, and the two women.”
