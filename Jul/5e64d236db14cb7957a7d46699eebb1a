Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have shot dead the daughter of a retired Navy Rear Admiral, J Onubi, and his driver along the Lokoja-Abuja highway. The driver was identified as Pomtd Lifu Ji with navy number X9307. Their remains have since been moved to the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja. SaharaReporters gathered that Onubiâ€™s orderly, Osca Ahmadu, who was in the same vehicle with the victims, escaped into the bush. The incident happened hours after an unidentified naval officer and a woman in camouflage were killed along the same highway. On July 7, a Nigerian Army officer, GSM Abubakar, attached to the 353 Artillery Regiment, was also killed on the notorious Okene -Lokoja highway, while travelling from Lagos to the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji.
