Ex-Speaker of Nigeria's House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party for the All Progressives Congress. Yobe State governor and Chairman of the APC Caretaker committee, Mai Mala Buni, made the revelation in Abuja on Friday when he took Dogara for a meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa. “He is now a member of the APC,” Buni told journalists after the meeting.
