National President of Niger Delta Youth Association Worldwide, Comrade Victor James, in a statement to the British Human Rights Commission, has called on the Nigerian Government to respect the fundamental rights and dignity of activists, Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare. According to James, “Any attempt to rearrest Sowore and Bakare would worsen the existing abysmal human rights record in Nigeria and the existing loss of public trust in the judiciary and security service.” James said the call was in line with the United Nations human rights convention.
