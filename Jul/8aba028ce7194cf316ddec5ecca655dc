2 Weeks Ago Niger State rights activist, Abubakar Saidu Arah, hailed the court for the prompt judgment delivery on the case. He urged the government to strengthen the National Human Right Commission and Niger State Child's Right Agency, stating that the state government should take proactive steps in ensuring the implementation of the child’s right act in the state. He said, “The federal and Niger State governments should empower the National Human Right Commission and Niger State Child's Right Agency to do better than keeping statistics and records (as shown in this case) and be proactive in handling offences of such magnitude as some victims lack the strength to follow up such cases to the desired conclusion without their support.”
