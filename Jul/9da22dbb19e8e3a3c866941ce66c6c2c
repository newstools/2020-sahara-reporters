SaharaReporters in a series of well detailed reports backed with relevant documents had exposed how Obasa through different guises signed off various sums of money for himself and close allies in the Lagos Assembly.

1 Month Ago Aside from using Ajayi Mudashiru Obasa, he also used Obasa Abdulrahman Gbadunola and Gabriel Adedoyin Savage to register some of the bank accounts. SaharaReporters had exposed how Obasa awarded contracts to himself using different companies owned by him and how he got the Assembly to approve N258m for printing of invitation cards for the inauguration of lawmakers two months after the event held. Other reports also revealed how he approved N17m monthly to maintain his personal residence and guest house, and N53m from the state coffers to travel with his mistress to the United States of America. It was also revealed that 19 lawmakers led by Obasa went for a women leadership programme and received N80m as estacode after returning from the programme. Following the plethora of allegations against him and the demand by several civil society groups calling for an investigation into the scandal, the EFCC recently launched a probe on the matter especially after the public rejected the sham investigation carried out by the Lagos Assembly members to let Obasa off the hook. Responding to calls for a probe last week, Zonal Head of the EFCC, Mohammed Rabo, disclosed that they will ensure all allegations against the Lagos Assembly Speaker were looked into with the aim of bringing him to justice if found culpable of financial misappropriation.

1 Month Ago “Obasa and other principal lawmakers have been daily seeing to the alteration of financial records all in a bid to escape being realised by the EFCC. They are in serious panic because they fear that once the EFCC nails them for all the financial fraud that had been reported, it could mean the end of their political careers,” a source in the Assembly told SaharaReporters on Friday. The leadership of the All Progressives Congress in Lagos and at the national level is believed to have given an express order to Obasa to clear his name or risk losing his position in the Assembly and party in general. Desperate to meet that target, the Lagos Speaker is doing everything within his powers to ensure that he doesn’t go down with this scandal.
