If I were still Minister of Aviation and he tried this nonsense with any of those in my ministry or parastatals, I would ban him from the airports and from flying in Nigeria and if he ever assaulted any of my officials or staff, I would have him arrested, chained, detained, prosecuted and jailed. “One day we will meet and I will tell him all this to his face. I can’t wait.”
