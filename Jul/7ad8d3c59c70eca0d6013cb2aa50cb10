A police source, who confirmed the development, said the victims were set free after paying a huge sum of money as ransom. "They regained freedom after one the victim’s relation based in Abuja paid the ransom to the hoodlums," the police source said. Eight of the travellers were set free on Monday while one had earlier regained freedom on Sunday night and reunited with his family.
