Some All Progressives Congress governors were given 150 slots in the ongoing N-Power recruitment exercise, SaharaReporters has gathered. SaharaReporters had earlier reported how the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Umar Farouq, had converted the N-Power scheme to political patronage. A recent discovery by SaharaReporters shows that the minister has been giving out free slots to politicians and influential individuals with at least 150 slots given to some governors in the country. Sources privy to the ongoing scandal said the slots were mainly given to governors belonging to the All Progressives Congress.
