Dozens of N-Power beneficiaries on Wednesday held a rally to the Presidential Villa in Abuja to commend the Nigerian Government for establishing the scheme and other Social Intervention Programmes in the country. Led by Concerned Citizens/N-Power Forum, participants in the rally thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for creating the scheme, which they say would lead to sustainable growth and development in the country. According to the group in a statement, the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme, National Cash Transfer Programme, Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme and N-Power, have all had a positive impact on ordinary Nigerians.

This is also a display of the understanding of the critical role of youths in the socio-economic development of Nigeria,” the group said. See Also
