Two personnel of the Nigeria Police Force have been arrested in connection with a video on social media showing police officers molesting and harassing a lady caught at the residence of a kidnap and armed robbery suspect. The policemen from Lagos had gone for operation in Ibadan, Oyo State, to arrest the suspected armed robber and met the lady, who gave her name as Towobola, there. The policemen after taking the kidnap suspect away, faced Towobola, handcuffed and accused her of sleeping with him.   The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, while condemning the act of the officers, ordered a discreet investigation into the circumstances surrounding the dehumanising treatment meted out to the lady.
