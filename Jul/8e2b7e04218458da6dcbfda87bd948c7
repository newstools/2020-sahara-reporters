Fear has seized Ondo State Executive Council members as they await results of their COVID-19 tests. Cabinet members were made to undergo a compulsory Coronavirus test after Governor Rotimi Akeredolu was confirmed to have contracted the virus earlier in the week.  Apart from Akeredolu, his wife, Betty, some of their aides and several other government officials have all been confirmed to have the virus. On Thursday, Commissioner for Health in the state, Wahab Adegbenro, died of Coronavirus complications after being ill for a few days. As a result of this development, cabinet members are now living in fear especially as they all await the outcome of the test conducted on them.
