The Nigerian Government on Tuesday said President Muhammadu Buhari's administration was not losing the war against corruption as being speculated by opposition parties in the country. It asked those who feel otherwise especially leaders of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party to dare the law and bear the consequence. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, disclosed this on Tuesday at a press conference on the state of the nation in Abuja.  The minister noted that the revelations especially investigation of the suspended Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, had shown that the administration was not ready to sweep any allegation of corruption under the carpet. The minister said, “Many, especially naysayers, have misinterpreted these developments as a sign that the administration’s fight against corruption is waning. "In fact, the main opposition PDP has latched onto the developments to call for the resignation of Mr President, a call that is nothing but infantile. "President Buhari, the African Union’s anti-corruption champion, who also has an impeccable reputation globally, remains the driver of the fight. “No one, not the least the PDP under whose watch Nigeria was looted dry, can taint his image or reverse the gains of the fight. "Anyone who disagrees that the anti-corruption fight is alive and well is free to dare us.” He said the revelations had equally shown that there were no sacred cows in the fight against corruption by government. He added, "Unlike the PDP, we will not cover up for anyone including the members of our party and government, who faces corruption allegations. “Our fight against corruption is blind to party affiliation, position in government and any other consideration. "If the nation’s anti-corruption czar can be investigated, then the fight against corruption cannot be deemed to be fake, neither can it be said to be waning.”
