 Following an order of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday ordering the release from house arrest of deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, the ex-monarch is now on his way out of the Awe tow in Nasarawa State where he had been held up. His exit from the community comes shortly after a visit by Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai, on Friday. Kano State Executive Council approved Sanusi’s dethronement at a special sitting held on Monday.
