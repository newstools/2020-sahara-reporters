Wale Babalakin The Academic Staff Union of Universities at the University of Lagos has warned Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council of the institution, Dr Wale Babalakin, not to visit the school’s campus again. Chairman of ASUU at UNILAG, Dr Dele Ashiru, said that the decision was reached during a recent congress of the union. He said, “Dr Wale Babalakin is now a persona non grata on our campus. We don’t want to see him again anywhere in the university. He is no longer needed.” The union’s position follows the suspension of UNILAG’s convocation ceremony as a result of a disagreement between the governing council led by Babalakin and management of the school led by the Vice Chancellor, Prof Toyin Ogundipe.
