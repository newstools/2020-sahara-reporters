  Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has tested positive for Coronavirus and the club's game against Brighton on Saturday has been postponed, according to the BBC. Arsenal has closed its training ground and club staff, who had recent contact with Arteta will now self-isolate. The Premier League will hold "an emergency club meeting" on Friday to discuss future fixtures. "This is really disappointing," said 37-year-old Arteta. "I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as I'm allowed," he added. Arsenal expects a "significant number of people" will self-isolate, including the "full first-team squad". The club were due to face Brighton in the Premier League at Amex Stadium on Saturday but Brighton released a statement shortly after confirmation of Arteta's positive test, announcing that the game had been called off. All 20 Premier League clubs want to decide on a unified strategy, and one of the possible options that will be discussed at the meeting is postponing the rest of this weekend's scheduled fixtures.
