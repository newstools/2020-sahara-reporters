  The legal team of dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has said that they will challenge the Kano State Government’s decision to banish him from the state. They said that the banishment was an infringement on his constitutional right and liberty. Announcing the decision on Tuesday during a press briefing, head of Sanusi’s legal team, Abubakar Balarabe Mahmoud (SAN), said that they were however, yet to get any further instruction from him. He said, “We have the directives of the emir through his Chief of Staff, Munir Sanusi, to challenge the legality of his banishment. “We have not received any directive to challenge his dethronement but we have been directed to challenge his banishment.” Kano State Executive Council approved Sanusi’s dethronement at a special sitting held on Monday. Since coming on the throne, Sanusi, who rose to become Governor of Nigeria’s Central Bank as a professional, has always spoken out against harmful traditions and practices in the North, often times drawing the ire of elites in the region. He has been banished to a town named Loko in Nasarawa State where he is expected to live quietly with his family.
