  The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has advised all air passengers to obey directives issued by officials of Port Health Services at various points of entry into the country. The agency disclosed that it was working with relevant authorities like the Ministry of Health and other stakeholders to curb the spread of Coronavirus in Nigeria. A statement by Capt. Musa Nuhu, Director-General, NCAA, said that it was necessary for passengers to heed to the guidance of health officials at airports on the use of screening forms and other measures put in place.
