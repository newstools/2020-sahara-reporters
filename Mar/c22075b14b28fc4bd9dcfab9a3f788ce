  The management of the Federal Inland Revenue Service has denied that one of its staff tested positive for Coronavirus. This comes after three cases of the virus were discovered and confirmed in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, on Saturday. In a statement by the Director, Communications and Liaison Department, FIRS, Abdullahi Ismaila Ahmad, the agency said that news making the rounds on social media that one of its staff tested positive to COVID-19 was false. The statement reads, “The attention of the Executive Chairman, FIRS, Mr Muhammad Nami, and management of the service has been drawn to the fake news that a member of staff tested positive for COVID-19. “The service hereby states unequivocally that no member of staff at the FIRS has tested positive to COVID-19 as being peddled on social media. “The service can confirm that a member of staff who went to pick his wife from the airport following her return from a trip abroad is currently and voluntarily observing the Federal Government advisory of self-isolation alongside his spouse at the couple’s home since Monday. “Both husband and wife have not visited any FIRS offices or events since the wife returned to Nigeria last Sunday. “More importantly, both husband and wife have only been in self-isolation for five days and have not tested positive to Covid-19. “Before now, all FIRS offices have taken necessary precautions to protect both staff and taxpayers from Covid-19 through such safety measures as social distancing, temperature testing, disabling of the biometric sign in, and provision of hand sanitisers for staff and visitors to our offices nationwide as advised by the Federal Ministry of Health. “Members of the public are therefore advised to discountenance the claim that an FIRS official has tested positive to Covid-19.” Ten new cases of the pandemic were confirmed in Nigeria on Saturday, bringing the total cases to 22 in the country.
