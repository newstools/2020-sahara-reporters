  A Magistrates Court in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, has remanded one Ogbonna Nwafor in prison for allegedly killing his wife. According to reports, Nwafor allegedly killed his wife after they quarrelled the previous night. It was alleged that the suspect lifted his wife and hit her on a wheelbarrow which led to her death. Further investigations revealed that the accused person committed the offence at Amachi Village in the Izzi Local Government Area of the state on March 5, 2020. He was arraigned on one count of murder on Friday. The police prosecutor, Inspector Edet Effiong, told the court that the offence was punishable under Section 319 (1) of the Criminal Code Cap. 33, Vol. 1, Laws of Ebonyi State of Nigeria, 2009. The charge read, “That you, Ogbonna Nwafor, on March 5, 2020, at Amachi, Izzi LGA, under the jurisdiction of this honourable court, did unlawfully cause the death of one Nnenna Nwafor ‘by hitting her on a wheelbarrow, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 319 (1) of the Criminal Code Cap. 33, Vol. 1, Laws of Ebonyi State of Nigeria, 2009.” There was no appearance in court by a defence counsel and no bail application was made on his behalf. The presiding Chief Magistrate, Mr Chinedu Agama, said the court lacked the jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matter.
