  Residents of Abuja on Monday thronged banking halls, shopping malls and supermarkets to make last-minute cash withdrawals and purchases of basic food items and toiletries ahead of a lockdown in the city. President Muhammadu Buhari had on Sunday ordered a total lockdown of activities in Lagos, Ogun and Federal Capital Territory for two weeks as part of measures to stem the spread of Coronavirus pandemic in the country. As early as 7:00am, residents of Abuja had besieged premises of various banks to make cash withdrawals that would last them for the duration of the restriction. Customers were seen at a branch of First Bank located in Kubwa struggling to gain access into the banking hall. The situation was the same at the Automated Teller Machine point of many banks where dozens of persons gathered to collect cash. Many business owners took advantage of the situation to make extra profit by inflating prices of basic items including foodstuffs following the surge in customers at most markets in Abuja. Also, filling stations were not left out in the rush as many people were seen trying to buy petrol for domestic use. Residents expressed mixed reactions on the lockdown order, describing it as a pain and sacrifice citizens had to make to help stop the spread of the virus.
