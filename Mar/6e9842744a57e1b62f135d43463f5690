 At least three persons working in the office of Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, have tested positive to Coronavirus. The affected persons are yet to be identified but it is believed that they are close members of Kyari's work unit. This came after it emerged that Kyari tested positive for the virus after a trip to Germany and Egypt where the pandemic had killed dozens of persons. SaharaReporters had on Monday exclusively reported that Kyari was seriously ill and suspected of having Coronavirus after returning from trips to Germany and Egypt where the virus had killed dozens of persons in recent weeks. A top government source confirmed the latest development to SaharaReporters on Tuesday, adding that there were plans to move Kyari to Lagos for urgent and effective treatment. Lagos has one of the most functional infectious diseases treatment and isolation centres in the country. An Italian man, who first imported the virus into Nigeria in February, was successfully treated at the Lagos centre at Yaba before being declared free of the pandemic and released to go home. In the face of a global lockdown and with many countries with functional health systems closing their borders to international visitors, the Lagos Centre is perhaps one of the few places to successfully deal with Kyari's case at this time. Since returning from the trip abroad, Kyari has had contacts with several prominent persons including Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to President Buhari, Babagana Kingibe, a prominent member of the 'cabal' and Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello. Aliko Dangote, Governor Bello Masari of Katsina and Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, are among others that Kyari came in contact with after returning from his foreign trip. Already, activities at Aso Villa, Nigeria's seat of power, have been shut down to avoid a further spread of the virus.
