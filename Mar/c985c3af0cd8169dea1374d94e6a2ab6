A police sergeant, Abdulrazaq Dahiru, has been arrested and kept in custody in Adamawa State for kidnapping. Commissioner of Police in the state, Audu Madaki, made the disclosure on Wednesday in Yola, the state capital. The arrested policeman was said to have allegedly supplied kidnappers nine live ammunition on three different occasions. Madaki said, "The new collaboration between Adamawa State Police Command and Fulani volunteer groups to checkmate the activities of criminals in the state has started yielding results with the arrest of 71 suspected kidnappers, armed robbers and rapists. "The suspects had conspired and kidnapped people in the state and collected N3.8m as ransom. â€œOn March 8, 2020, while interrogating the kidnappers, one among them confessed to having been romancing with the NCO, Sgt. Abdulrazaq Dahiru." Items recovered from the suspects include 13 AK 47 rifles, 761 rounds of live ammunition, 18 magazines and five locally made pistols.
