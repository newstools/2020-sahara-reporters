 Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja, has adjourned the trial of rights activists, Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare until April 1, 2020. Ojukwu, who was angry at the way the  prosecution was delaying the trial, adjourned the case at the instance of the objection raised by lead defence counsel, Femi Falana, when the first prosecution witness, Rasheed Olawale, was giving evidence out of the summary statement. Falana urged the court to limit and restrict the witness to the summary of the statement that was made available to them by the prosecution. He argued that the evidence being given by the witness was mischievous and alien to section 36 of the constitution that guarantees fair hearing.

4 Hours Ago In his own submission, prosecution counsel, A.A Aliyu, asked the court to dismiss Falana's objection on the grounds that the evidence given by the witness would not amount to miscarriage of justice as painted by the defence. The trial judge therefore asked the prosecution to reproduce the witness statement in details to accommodate whatever evidence the witness want to give whenever it was called upon. The judge said, "Serve them these evidence, I don't know what is difficult in that. Serve them all the evidence you want to rely on. "That should not be difficult and that is the provision of the law."
