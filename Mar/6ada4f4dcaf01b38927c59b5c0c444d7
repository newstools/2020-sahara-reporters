  Internally displaced persons at the Fufore Camp in Adamawa State have rejected food supplied by the National Emergency Management Agency. The IDPs said they were short-changed in the latest supply after it came after four months of neglect. The latest move by NEMA was in reaction to a story by SaharaReporters on Wednesday revealing how displaced persons were protesting the lack of food and water at the camp. Leader of the displaced persons, Umar Bakura, informed our correspondent that they had resolved to embark on hunger strike to register their grievances.
