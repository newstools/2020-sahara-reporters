  The World Health Organisation has warned young people to protect themselves against Coronavirus, adding that the pandemic can get them hospitalised for weeks or even kill them. According to AFP, the global health organisation warned that young people were not invincible to the virus, adding that their actions could determine whether they got infected or not. The pandemic has affected lives across the planet, sharply restricting the movement of huge populations, shutting down schools and businesses, and forcing millions to work from home — while many have lost their livelihoods entirely. While President Donald Trump insisted the United States was “winning” the war against the virus, individual states dramatically ramped up restrictions, with New York and Illinois joining California in ordering residents to stay at home. The virus death toll surged past 11,000 worldwide, with 4,000 alone in worst-hit Italy where the daily number of fatalities has shot up relentlessly over the past week. While the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions are the hardest hit by the virus, WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that young people were also vulnerable. “Today I have a message for young people: you are not invincible. This virus could put you in hospital for weeks — or even kill you,” Tedros said. “Even if you don’t get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else,” he added. China on Saturday reported no new local infections for a third straight day, and the WHO said the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year, offered a glimmer of “hope for the rest of the world”.
