 Nigerian activist, Oluwaseun Ayodeji Osowobi, founder of Stand to End Rape (STER), has given a detailed account into her remarkable journey to recovery from Coronavirus (COVID-19). Osowobi, who tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after returning to Nigeria from the United Kingdom where she had attended a commonwealth event, said she fought to live. Sharing her experience on Twitter, she said, “I thought I was going to die and contemplated a succession plan for @StandtoEndRape. "I was on drugs daily. Sometimes, I‘d take eight tablets in the morning, 13 tablets in the afternoon, 10 at night. “My system threw everything out. Water, food, soap and all disgusted me. But I’d look at the wall and force myself to stay hydrated. I fought to live! I fought. “I was unsure of what was going on. Why haven’t I been discharged? Should I be in the same ward? Could I get reinfected? I was worried but remained calm. "On the the third day, doctors said, well, we worked with the info we had of you testing negative, but one result came back positive. “Today, I am proud to inform you that I murdered COVID-19 and have tested negative twice! I have been discharged. Today, I am PROUD to inform you that I MURDERED COVID-19 & have tested NEGATIVE TWICE! I HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED!ð¤¸ð¾ââï¸I bless God for His mercies.ðð½The nurses at IDH Yaba were fab. They deserve accolades for their hardwork.Thank you Governor @jidesanwoolu for coming to see me.ðð½  “Coronavirus is not a death sentence. People can survive and I have. “We should encourage people to get tested and stop the stigma. "Practise social distancing and stop the spread. "NCDC and state governments need to improve their testing capacity. Test mild/asymptomatic cases too. "Sending strength to everyone fighting to beat #COVID19.” Nigeria currently has 131 confirmed cases of Coronavirus and two confirmed deaths. As a result of the pandemic, President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday ordered a total lockdown in Lagos, Ogun and FCT to curb the spread of the virus.
