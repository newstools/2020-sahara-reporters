 The All Progressives Congress has refuted reports that it will be convening an emergency National Executive Committee meeting to solve its ongoing intra-party leadership crisis. The party in a statement jointly signed by Babatunde Ogala, National Legal Adviser; Lanre Issa-Onilu, National Publicity Secretary; and Waziri Bulama, National Secretary; also denied the notice issued by Acting National Secretary, Chief Victor T. Giadom, claiming that Giadom does not have the power to convene a NEC meeting. In the fresh statement, the APC stated that the conditions for which a national executive committee meeting could be convened as provided by Article 25(B)(i) and (ii) of the APC constitution is yet to be met.
