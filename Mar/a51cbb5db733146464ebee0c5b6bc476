Google An Islamic cleric based in Australia, Mohammad Tawhidi popularly known as 'Imam of Peace', has slammed Nigeria's President, Muhammadu Buhari, over his failure to address Nigerians on the Coronavirus pandemic that is spreading rapidly across the country and wreaking havoc. Tawhidi also berated Buhari for his poor handling of terrorism in Nigeria especially in the North-East region where Boko Haram has killed thousands and displaced millions. Expressing his thoughts on Twitter on Friday, Tawhidi said Buhari was not fit to be Nigeria's President.

Addressing the nation about it for the first time, he pronounced the virus as 'CIVIK 1-9'.His friend, Imran Khan, thinks Japan and Germany share a border.  According to him, the Nigerian Government under Buhari had failed the citizens. He said, "Weak leadership of Buhari, failed President. No realistic agenda to tackle Jihadists. All talk. "You don't even know the name of disease killing your people." Islamists in Nigeria are destroying Christian communities. Weak leadership of Buhari.Failed President.
