In a statement on Friday, Odumakin said, "Our attention has been drawn to the alarm raised by Publisher of SaharaReporters, Mr Omoyele Sowore, that the Federal Government was planning an onslaught on him for reporting that Mr Abba Kyari was Coronavirus positive. "Does it mean that our government would have concealed Kyari's status and allowed Coronavirus unchecked among the top echelon of Nigerian society? "If the status of UK Prime Minister can be made public, who is Kyari that his status must not be known?" she queried.

She advised government to begin to remedy its failure by doing whatever it can to provide services for citizens.
