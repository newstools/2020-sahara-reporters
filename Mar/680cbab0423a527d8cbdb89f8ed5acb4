 The National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives has held a peaceful walk to show their displeasure against the recent move by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria to recruit secondary school graduates into the nursing scheme. The NMCN had cited the shortage of human resources for health at the rural areas due to the mass migration to urban areas and other countries by nurses as a reason for the recruitment. The nursing council stated that the introduction of Community Nursing Programme would meet the health care needs of rural communities and hard to reach areas and also help to achieve Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage in Nigeria. It added that upon completion of the programme, students shall be registered as a licensed community nurse by the NMCN to practice in homes, primary health care centres and communities in Nigeria. In expressing their displeasure against the move, nurses under the umbrella of Nursing Group Administrators described the recruitment as a political move rather than a professional one. The group added that there was no proof of need for the establishment of the licensed community nursing, saying it was ‘ridiculous’ and being done to push the agenda of a particular region of the country. The nurses, who held a peaceful protest walk to the Nursing and Midwifery Council office, chanted songs and carried placards to display their frustration. The nurses also stated that the Nigerian Government was running from its responsibility of providing quality healthcare for the people. They also claimed that most state governments had not announced PHC employment in two years, stressing that the scheme would further compound the problem facing the health system in the country.
