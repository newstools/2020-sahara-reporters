  A fierce windstorm has destroyed the broadcast mast of Glory FM, a radio station owned by Bayelsa State Government. The fallen mast, occasioned by a heavy downpour on Monday night in Yenagoa, the state capital, also destroyed part of the building housing the radio station. The collapsed mast also served the Nigerian Television Authority and Radio Nigeria Creek FM.
