 Sultan of Sokoto,  Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, has slammed some Islamic clerics over their non-adherence to instructions by experts on how to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. Abubakar, who spoke under the auspices of Jama’atu Nasril Islam, said the preaching of some of the clerics “clearly depicts sheer whims and caprices of their myopic worldview, stark ignorance of reality based on genuine knowledge and medical scholarship. It is however, regrettable that as the negative actions of such preachers incites”. He further said, “It is thus sheer monumental ignorance to falsely claim that the pandemic of Coronavirus does not exist and that it is a lie and a shadow of a ghost. Such lamentable utterances leave much to be desired by any scholar. “For the information of discerning minds, there were prominent incidents of plagues and epidemics in Islamic history, which caused monumental mortality. As a result of which various safety steps were taken, so as to curtail the spread of such viruses. Such steps extended to the stoppage of congregational prayers including Jumu’ah (Friday) prayer with an interim halt to the performance of Hajj (pilgrimage). “Without mincing words, the Coronavirus pandemic has reminded mankind that despite our advancement in science and technology, God – the Almighty is the Supreme Being and has control over our affairs. "This pandemic further reminds mankind that whatever our discovery, if we deny His existence, He will only allow us be for only sometime! “Nigerian medics must however watch out for their safety, while treating cases of Coronavirus patients to avoid collateral damage on the health. "Government on the other hand must take all necessary proactive measures in providing emergency manpower, equipment as well as provide more testing kits and isolation centres."
