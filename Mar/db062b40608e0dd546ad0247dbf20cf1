  Nationals from Norway and Turkey have imported Coronavirus into Ghana, the country's Health Minister, Kwasi Agyemang-Manu, disclosed. These are the first set of confirmed cases from the country. Ghana had earlier tested about 57 cases which all returned negative. Agyemang-Manu said the two positive results came in the same time from the Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research “Laboratory results of the two confirmed cases were received at the same time from the Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research. Both individuals returned to Ghana, one from Norway, and the other from Turkey, so these are imported cases of COVID-19. “I wish to assure all Ghanaians that the Government of Ghana together with all health partners will continue to work assiduously to ensure the situation is contained. Both patients are currently being kept in isolation and are stable. We have initiated processes for contact tracing,” a statement from the Ministry of Health said. In an address to the nation on Wednesday, the President, Nana Akufo-Addo, assured Ghanaians of the preparedness of the country to handle the situation should there be an outbreak. He further indicated that the government had directed the release of the cedi equivalent of $100m to boost the nation’s preparedness and response to the COVID-19. “At my prompting, the Minister for Finance has made available the cedi equivalent of $100m to enhance our Coronavirus preparedness and response plan,” President Akufo-Addo said.
