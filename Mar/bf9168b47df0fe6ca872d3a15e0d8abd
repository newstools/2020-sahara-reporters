 A United Kingdom returnee showing symptoms of Coronavirus during a visit to Ondo State, has been forced to go into self-isolation after initially causing panic and fear among residents, SaharaReporters can confirm. The middle-aged woman had travelled to Agadagba-Obon in Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State after arriving Lagos from the UK recently. A resident of the community, who spoke with our correspondent on Monday, said, “Some medical personnel traced the woman to Agadagba-Obon after a distress call and took her blood sample for testing before she was asked to self-isolate.” Caretaker Chairman of Ese Odo Local Government Area, Hon. Ojo Omolewa, confirmed the case while speaking with SaharaReporters on Monday. Omolewa disclosed that the blood sample of the woman had been taken to Osun State for testing. He said, “It is true, we are suspecting the case and we have taken the blood sample of the woman to a laboratory in Ede, Osun State, for testing. “We were able to gather that she entered a vehicle from Lagos to Ore and from there to Agadagba-Obon and her family are aware of her situation. “I advise people of Ese Odo not to panic because the woman has already self-isolated.” Nigeria currently has 111 confirmed cases of Coronavirus and one recorded death.
