ATM withdrawal A joint statement by Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, and Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, has said e-payment and ATM platforms will remain open during the restriction on movement in Lagos, FCT and Ogun State. The monetary and fiscal policy heads said exemptions have been obtained from President Muhammadu Buhari to allow very skeletal operations in the financial system and money markets. They directed that all relevant staff of affected outfits and agencies should look out for further instructions from their immediate bosses. The statement reads, “To ensure that Nigerians can still perform online transactions and use ATMs whilst observing these restrictions, we will like to inform the general public and all affected stakeholders that we have obtained exemptions from the President to allow very skeletal operations in the Financial System and Money Markets in order to keep the system in light operations during this time. “We are mindful of the difficulties these restrictions would bring on ordinary Nigerians and are grateful to the President for approving these exemptions, which should help ease some of these burdens. “We urge all Nigerians to be patient, cooperative and united as all hands are on deck to defeat this virus.”
