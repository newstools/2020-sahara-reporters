  As earlier reported by SaharaReporters, the Nigerian Army has announced the redeployment of senior officers, claiming that the move was in a bid to add freshness into the war against terrorism in the country. The posting, which was approved by the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Yusuf Buratai, led to the removal of Maj. Gen. Olusegun Adeniyi as Theatre Command Operation LAFIYA DOLE, the group fighting Boko Haram terrorists in the North-East region of the country. Adeniyi, who spoke out against the lack of weapons and accurate intelligence to fight terrorists in the region in a video that went viral a few days ago, was moved to the Nigerian Army Resource Centre as Senior Research Fellow after his outburst embarrassed the military authorities.
