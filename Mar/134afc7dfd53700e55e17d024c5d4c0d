The rain, which fell on Thursday night, also wreaked havoc on residents of Olu foam, Omoniyi Estate and Igoba community in the state capital.

The rainstorm also damaged several electricity poles, leaving residents in total blackout. During a visit to some of the affected buildings, landlords were seen removing blown off roofs. One affected resident, Mr Ayeni Abayomi, described the damage by the rainstorm as a big disaster. â€œWhat happened yesterday (Thursday) was beyond imagination. "It started around 6pm and many properties were destroyed. It is beyond our capacity," he said. Another resident, Helen Eniola, said the rainstorm was terrible and very devastating."Our properties were destroyed and we lost many things. I was in my house throughout when it started," she said. Femisola Olofinsawo, a retiree badly affected by the storm, pleaded with Ondo State Government to come to their aid. "The rain started and next thing we heard was heavy breeze and houses started collapsing. "The little shop I have has been blown off. We are pleading with the state and federal governments to come to our aid," she added.
