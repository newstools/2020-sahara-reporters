 The All Progressives Congress has confirmed that it would hold its National Working Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, 2020. The date for the NWC meeting was announced by National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, on Monday night. Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, had earlier on Monday announced the indefinite suspension of the meeting scheduled to hold on March 17, 2020. The announcement was made after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday. In the fresh notice by Issa-Onilu, he said that all members of the National Working Committee were expected to attend the meeting. “A meeting of the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress is scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at the party's National Secretariat by 12pm. “All members of the NWC are expected to attend as important matters concerning the party will be considered and deliberated at the meeting,” the notice read. Recall that a Court of Appeal on Monday stayed the execution order of a high court restraining the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, from acting in that capacity.
