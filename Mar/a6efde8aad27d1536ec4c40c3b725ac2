Hundreds of protesters have stormed the Kano Hisbah office over a song allegedly blaspheming Prophet Mohammed. Idris Ibrahim, better known as Baba Idris, convener of the protest, said if government failed to do the needful; they will take the law into their hands. Musician, Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, is said to have composed a song containing alleged derogatory comments attributed to Prophet Mohammed. This prompted violence against family members of the musician, who went into hiding last week. Last Friday, family house of the artiste located at Sharifai quarters in Kano Municipal Local Government Area was set ablaze by irate youth over the song. The singer is said to be a member of the Islamic Tijjaniya sect and Faidha group. He is yet to speak on the matter, Premium Times reports. While addressing protesters, the Kano Hisbah Commander, Harun Ibn-Sina, said officials in the state are on top of the situation and that parents of the musician had been arrested.
