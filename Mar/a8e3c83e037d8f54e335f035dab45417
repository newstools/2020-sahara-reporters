 The German Government is set to airlift its citizens from Nigeria following the outbreak and continued spread of Coronavirus. In a statement on the website of the German Mission in Nigeria, citizens of Germany interested in going back home at this time are advised to complete certain forms immediately. It said, “Due to the extraordinary circumstances with regard to COVID-19, temporary entry restrictions were decided for Germany and international air traffic to and from Nigeria until April 23. “Some compatriots and their family members were able to leave Nigeria before the above measures were introduced. “The German Embassy in Abuja and the German Consulate-General in Lagos want to determine as reliably as possible the number of German compatriots and their family members who are still in Nigeria and are interested in returning to Germany.” Already, France and Israel have started moving out their citizens from Nigeria while the United States is concluding plans to do so any moment from now. Nigeria has 111 confirmed cases of Coronavirus at the moment and one recorded death. The pandemic has infected over 700,000 people and claimed more than 27,000 lives across the world since the virus broke out in Wuhan, China.
