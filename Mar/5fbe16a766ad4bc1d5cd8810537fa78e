A bunch of former Niger Delta militants granted amnesty on Monday morning blocked Mbiama Junction, a border town between Rivers and Bayelsa states, to protest two months of unpaid stipends. The situation led to the obstruction of free flow of traffic in the area with pedestrians and persons around the place at the time expressing worry of possible violence as a result of the incident. Over recent months, various groups of ex-militants have taken to the streets to register their displeasure at not being paid their allowances regularly.
