1 Day Ago Kyari has tested positive for the virus. The governor said, "Having received news that one of the persons at a meeting I attended tested positive for #COVID-19, I have willingly volunteered to get tested for it in spite of the fact that many others at the said meeting tested negative to make assurance doubly sure. I am well and asymptomatic. "The result of the test will be made public in due course."
