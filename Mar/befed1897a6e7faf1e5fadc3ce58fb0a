 A widow based in Benin, Edo State, Mrs Success Andrew, has appealed to well-meaning Nigerians and government to come to her aid over the killing of her husband and bread winner of their family. The woman alleged that her husband, Oviemadha Andrew, a tipper driver, was hit by a police bullet on February 13, 2020 at the Eyaen part of Edo State while eating at a restaurant. That fateful day, some youth violently protested the extra judicial killing of a young man by a policeman from Delta State Command attached to a contractor executing a project in the community. According to Mrs Andrew, policemen from the Edo State Command, who later arrived the scene, shot sporadically to disperse the protesting youth and that it was in the process that a stray bullet hit and killed her husband eating at a nearby restaurant. The widow further disclosed that the policemen at the scene took the body of her husband away and had refused to release it to the family till date. Meanwhile, a Civil Rights Group in Benin, Talakawa's Parliament, had written a formal petition signed by leader of the group, Marxist Kola Edokpayi, to the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 5, on behalf of the victim’s family for an investigation to be carried out to ascertain the circumstance leading to Mr Andrew’s death. But up until this moment, nothing has been heard on the matter, according to the widow.
