Ten aides of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano have been caught in false assets declaration saga. This is coming about a month after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission arrested the Commissioner for Special Duties in Kano, Mukhtar Ishaq, over an alleged N86m fraud. Aides to the governor have failed to declare all of their assets with hidden assets running into billions of naira kept in local and foreign currency accounts, an investigation by PRNigeria has revealed. A list compiled by the Code of Conduct Bureau has full details of Ganduje's aides and staff, who have not only failed to fully declare their assets but also defaulted the statutes of the Code of Conduct Bureau.
