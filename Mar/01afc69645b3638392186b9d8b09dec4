  One of four doctors placed in isolation on Thursday after coming in contact with a man suspected of having Coronavirus at the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, Ondo Town, Ondo State, has now tested negative to the virus. A staff of the hospital confirmed to SaharaReporters on Saturday that series of tests carried out on the doctor had returned negative, erasing any fear that he might have been infected with the virus. The man suspected of having the virus is named David and had come into Nigeria from Maryland, United States, recently to visit family members. However, the status of the other three medical doctors is still unknown as they remain under keen observation. Result of the blood samples taken from the US returnee is also yet to be announced by the state government. Nigeria has recorded 12 cases of the pandemic with fears rising of a further spread of the virus.
