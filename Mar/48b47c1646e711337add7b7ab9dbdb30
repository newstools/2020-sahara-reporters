He said, “Majority of them are persons who came from overseas and the others have been traced as close contacts of such returnees. “The high number of imported cases in Lagos and Abuja is directly due to their function as the country gateway for air travels. “Till date, three persons have been discharged after successful treatments but sadly, another fatality was recorded over the weekend in the person of a patient who had severe underlying illnesses.” The latest incident comes one week after a former Managing Director of Petroleum Products Marketing Company, Suleiman Achimugu, died of the virus.
