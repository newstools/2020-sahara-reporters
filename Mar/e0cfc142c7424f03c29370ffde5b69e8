 The Action Democratic Party has called for an investigation to unravel the cause of the explosion that led to a fire incident at Abule-Ado area of Lagos State on Sunday. The explosion and ensuing fire led to the death of at least 17 persons with over 50 houses including a church and school destroyed. While the cause of the incident was yet to be ascertained, emergency agencies have claimed that a pipeline explosion did not cause it. The ADP described the event as a national tragedy that could have been avoided, adding that a thorough investigation must be carried out by the government. “The residents of Lagos woke up to a loud explosion, that was heard in most parts of the state on Sunday morning. “It is important that a thorough investigation is carried out. “The level of damage done by the explosion makes it very difficult to accept or reject what the cause could have been, but an extensive investigation should be carried out by the Lagos State and Federal governments to clear the air over this matter," a statement by National Publicity Secretary of ADP, Adelaja Adeoye, partly reads. The party posited that the frequency in the disasters, ranging from midnight market fire, explosions and other tragedies across the country was a serious source of worry and concern because they threatened the existence of citizens.
