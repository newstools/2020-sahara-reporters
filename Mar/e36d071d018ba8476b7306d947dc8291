  The Lagos State Government has said it will teach students eight subjects through television and radio. The move was to remedy the loss of time as school activities are suspended due to the Coronavirus outbreak. Commissioner for Education, Folashade Adefisayo, made the announcement in a statement on Saturday, adding that the programmes would ensure that students were engaged during the period of school closure. According to her, the programmes would have teachers specialised in core subjects as Mathematics, English language, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics, Literature in English and Financial Accounting take the various topics. She explained that the teachings would be recorded and circulated on various social media platforms for easy accessibility by students. According to her, the tutorial programmes are targeted at students preparing for West Africa Examinations Council, Basic Education Certificate Examination and other examinations. She advised parents against allowing their wards to patronise private tutorial centres during the period of school closure, so as to curb the spread of Coronavirus. She said, “Parents should ensure that their wards stay at home during this period and tune their radio or television sets to listen and watch Lagos sponsored teaching programmes.” Adefisayo urged students to observe basic hygiene such as avoiding body contact, large gatherings, close contact with a sick person or persons, regular hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers. She further urged the children to keep a distance of at least five feet from anyone coughing and sneezing.
