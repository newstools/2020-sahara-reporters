 President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he has no hand in the removal of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi as Emir of Kano. Buhari spoke through his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Wednesday. In a post on Twitter, he said, "President Muhammadu Buhari has no involvement whatsoever in the dethronement of HRH Muhammadu Sanusi II from the position of Emir of Kano. All such insinuations are untrue, malicious and politically motivated. "It is unfair and disingenuous of opposition politicians to try to link the situation in Kano State to the Federal Government and the Nigerian President. "President Buhari commends the people of Kano for keeping calm in the past few days of the dethronement announcement." Kano State Executive Council approved Sanusi’s dethronement at a special sitting held on Monday. Since coming on the throne, Sanusi, who rose to become governor of Nigeria’s Central Bank as a professional, has always spoken out against harmful traditions and practices in the North, often times drawing the ire of elites in the region. He has been banished to a town named Awe in Nasarawa State where he is expected to live quietly with his family.
