  President Donald Trump of the United States has ordered an immediate shut-down of all travel from Europe to America over the spread of Coronavirus. Addressing the nation on Wednesday, Trump said, “We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.” Speaking hours after world health officials declared the Coronavirus a pandemic, Trump repeatedly defended his own actions and vowed that the nation would prevail in countering the virus and getting treatment on the market, Daily Mail reports. Trump added, “The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.” The move was so sudden the acting Homeland Security secretary said he would issue full guidance on how to carry it out within 48 hours. The White House said the travel restrictions would apply to foreign nationals, who have visited 26 European countries but excluding the United Kingdom and Ireland in the past 14 days. It will not apply to US citizens, their 'immediate' family members or legal permanent residents.
