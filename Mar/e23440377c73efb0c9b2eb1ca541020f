 Nigerians on Twitter have come down hard on Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, for confidently flaunting the number of citizens killed daily by Malaria. Taking to his Twitter handle on Sunday, Shehu had while attacking the local media for giving a lot of attention to Coronavirus, said that focus should rather be on Malaria, which he says kills an average of 822 persons daily across Nigeria. He said, “This morning’s newspapers, all of them have Coronavirus as the lead, cover story. “When will they bring the spotlight to bear on 822 who are killed by Malaria every day in Nigeria?” Going by Shehu’s submission, it therefore means that at least 1,425,348 Nigerians have been killed by Malaria since President Buhari took office in May 2015. This is despite huge sums earmarked by the administration for the fight against the scourge. Shehu’s comment did not sit down well with many Nigerians on the popular social networking platform, who soon came for his head. Leading the charge, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, said, “When the incompetent, clueless, corrupt, inept and failure #ICCIF Major General Buhari @MBuhari that you work for decide to prioritise health sector the way he prioritises his healthcare in the United Kingdom.” When the incompetent, clueless, corrupt, inept and failure #ICCIF Major General Buhari @MBuhari that you work for decide to prioritise health sector the way he prioritises his healthcare in the United Kingdom https://t.co/CHxqfbD0aK  A user of the popular platform known as The Egalitarian, while reacting to Shehu’s Tweet, said, “Iran denied Coronavirus until it hit at their sit of power. “History repeats itself. Can wait to see a headline with @GarShehu quarantined.” Iran denied corona virus until it hit at their sit of power. History repeats itself. Can wait to see a headline with @GarShehu quarantined. ð  Ayekooto, another Twitter user, while adding his voice to the matter, said, “This is the last straw that has made me give up on this country. 822people die daily? That is 822 x 366= 300,852 x five years of this administration = over 1.5million people and yet @MBuhari has no emergency fumigation plan, treated net distribution or drug subsidy plan. Yet you tweet this.” This is the last straw that has made me give up on this country. 822people die daily? That is 822 x 366= 300,852 x 5yrs of this administration= over 1.5million people & yet @MBuhari has no emergency fumigation plan, treated net distribution or drug subsidy plan. Yet U tweet this!  In yet another scathing response to Buhari’s spokesperson, a young female Twitter user named Emmanuella, said, “Listen to your reasoning capability? If actually Malaria parasite was killing 822 Nigerians every day, whose fault is it? Am glad you are exposing the flaws of this government.” Listen to your reasoning capability ? If actually malaria parasite is killing 836 Nigerians everyday, whose fault is it ? Am glad u r exposing the flaws of this government.  In his own reaction, Immanuel Ibanga, another user of the popular platform, said, “Honestly, who selected/gathered this bunch of despicable mediocres as a team? “Garba is not ashamed that this government allows Malaria to kill 822 Nigerians every day. So if media report it, that'll bring the scourge to and end?” Honestly. Who selected/gathered this bunch of despicable mediocres as a team. Garba is not ashame that his Gov't allows malaria kill 822 Nigerians everyday. So if media report it that'll bring the scourge to and end?  His Knowledgeable, yet another user while adding his voice to the debate, said, “If according to you @GarShehu Malaria kills over 822 Nigerians daily under @Mbuhari, you are simply telling us that your boss has failed on public health. “Thanks a bunch for bragging over the deaths of over 822 hapless Nigerians to Malaria daily.” Also reacting, FS Yusuf, MIIM (Nonpartisan Democrat), said, “This is the height of psychosis. This is not surprising because it's obviously the testament of your substandard preparedness for the pandemic. “The morning's newspapers are tired of having the failures of your principal as the lead, cover story.”
