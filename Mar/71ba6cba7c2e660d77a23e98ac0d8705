REUTERS The Government of Ghana has ordered the closure of all schools and suspended public events to stop the spread of Coronavirus. President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, made the announcement in an address to the West African nation on Monday. He said the ban was until further notice. Public gatherings — including conferences, religious services, sports matches and political rallies — have also been suspended for four weeks, he said. Ghana on Sunday announced it would start barring entry into the country from Tuesday for any non-Ghanaian citizen or resident “who, within the last 14 days, has been to a country that has recorded at least 200 cases”, AFP reports. The move came as the authorities reported a rise in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 from two to six, with the new cases all arrivals from abroad. Numerous nations in sub-Saharan Africa — including Senegal, Kenya and South Africa — have begun imposing entry restrictions or closing schools as the continent scrambles to halt the spread of the virus.
