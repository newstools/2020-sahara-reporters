President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Abdullahi Ganduje  The Presidency in Nigeria has said that state governors had the powers to dethrone any traditional ruler in their domain. This was in reaction to the dethronement of Muhammed Sanusi II as Emir of Kano on Monday by the state government. Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on New Media, Tolu Ogunlesi, on Tuesday said, “A sitting governor can dethrone anybody – they have the power. That is the way the system is set up. Nobody is above being dethroned. Governors formally appoint them, present them the staff of office and fund their offices. “It actually didn’t start today, it has been so for a long time. “British deposed Obas of Lagos/Benin 1851/1897; Alake temporarily deposed by 1948 women’s riots; Awo deposed Alaafin 1955; Olowo deposed 1966; Edo military administrator tried to remove Oba of Benin as Chair, State Traditional Rulers Council 1999; Deji of Akure deposed 2010.”
