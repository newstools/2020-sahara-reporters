  The Lagos State Government has warned against the unprescribed use of Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, as preventive or curative drug against the Coronavirus disease. The warning is coming following the announcement of the United States President, Donald Trump, that the drug can now be used to treat Coronavirus. The announcement has been countered by the country’s Food and Drug Administration, which said it had not approved the use of the drug for treatment against Coronavirus. The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi, warned residents to avoid consumption of Chloroquine without prescription, noting that it could cause more harm than good to their health. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu during a live broadcast also cautioned residents against panic-buying of Chloroquine drugs, foodstuff and other household items.
