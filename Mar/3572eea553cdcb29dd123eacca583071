 Osagie Ehanire, Nigeria's Minister of Health, has said that the country had no new case of Coronavirus since the index case in the country was first diagnosed in an Italian. He made the revelation at a press conference to update Nigerians on the situation on Monday in Abuja. On those, who had contact with the quarantined Italian, Ehanire said, “The state has placed them under supervised self-isolation for 14 days. We will continue to monitor global situations with cases spreading quickly as they are doing now. “It is important for Nigerians to focus on facts and not on fear so as not to generate panic. Citizens should also desist from spreading fake news, especially on social media.” Apart from Nigeria, Egypt (one) and Algeria (three) are other countries in Africa that have recorded cases of the deadly virus.
