  Some gunmen over the weekend invaded the residence of a chairmanship candidate under the platform of Social Democratic Party in Ondo State, Mr Gbenga Fasua, destroying valuables in the process. Fasua explained that the armed men numbering about five, stormed his residence in Irese, a suburb of Akure, the state capital, at about 11:45pm and began to shoot sporadically to scare away neighbours. According to him, the hoodlums forcefully gained entry into his home and demanded his whereabouts from his wife. He said, “Immediately they saw my wife, they asked after me and she said I was not at home, but they told her they saw me from outside before gaining entrance, but at that time I was already hiding somewhere in the house.” Fasua added that the attackers ransacked his residence for several hours while searching for him. He revealed that the attackers destroyed some of his property including the doors, windows and television set before leaving with his vehicle. He stated, “After 35 minutes of serious searching for me, they requested for all ATM cards and destroyed many of my properties. “They left with my vehicle around 1:12am which was abandoned at Ijare, a nearby community. “I came out from where I was hiding at about 1:5am, went to Ijapo Police Station and reported the matter. “The patrol team came to my home at about 2:00am, saw the broken burglary doors and expended bullet pellets.” Tee-Leo Ikoro, spokesperson for the Ondo State Police Command, who confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters, said that investigation was ongoing to punish all those involve in the act.
