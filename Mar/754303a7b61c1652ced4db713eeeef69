The crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress has taken a new dimension as some supporters of the party removed billboards, banners and posters bearing images of the embattled National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, at the National secretariat in Abuja. The billboards and banners disappeared overnight from walls and strategic points around and inside the secretariat. There was also indication that Oshiomhole and some of his loyalists will not be present at next Tuesdayâ€™s National Executive Council meeting of the party. Only a billboard bearing the image of President Muhammadu Buhari was left standing at the national secretariat of the party as at the time of this report.
