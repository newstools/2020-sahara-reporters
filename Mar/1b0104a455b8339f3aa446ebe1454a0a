The Kaduna State Government has named deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, as Chancellor of Kaduna State University. This comes a day after the same state government appointed him into its investment board. Sanusi, a trained economist, rose to become governor of Nigeriaâ€™s Central Bank before being crowned Emir of Kano. The Kano State Government dethroned him on Monday after claiming that he was in the habit of disobeying laid down rules. He is currently in Nasarawa State where he was banished to after his dethronement. His lawyers are currently working to challenge that position.
