BusinessDay Media  There is an ongoing disagreement among members of the Kano State House of Assembly over a report recommending the removal of Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II. A group had on Wednesday last week submitted a petition before the House, calling for the emir’s removal for alleged violation of culture and tradition of the state. Speaker of the Assembly, Abdulaziz Gafasa, without reading the exact content of the petition set up a committee headed by the Deputy Speaker, Hamisu Chidari, to investigate and report within one week. According to Nigerian Daily, crisis broke out in the Assembly on Monday Morning when the Deputy Speaker sought the approval of the House to present the report. As members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party insisted that the report must be delayed till Tuesday for further investigation, the session went wild and the mace snatched by a member representing Warawa Constituency. Insiders said there are strong indications that the emir could be removed any moment from now, either after receiving the report of the House or that of the state anti-graft agency.
