  Presiding Bishop of Living Faith Church Worldwide better known as Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, has said that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was the worst the country had ever experienced. Oyedepo made the remarks on Sunday during service at the church in Ota, Ogun State. He said, “The government in this country is making a draconian law – hate speech. They said if you speak hatefully, you have committed murder. Out of someone who says I will kill you and the one who kill, who has committed a crime? I don’t understand which kind of animal farm we live in. “I said stop stepping on my toes and you said that is hate speech but somebody kills and he is walking free on the streets. This is the most stupid and nonsensical ideal anybody can think of. "I said you are bad and you said that is a crime. Must I say you are good when you are bad? “In my view you are bad and you shouldn’t be a leader. I have the right to say so. “As far as I am concerned, I am a true born and thoroughly-bred Nigerian, an intelligent one. In my view this is the worst thing that has happened to Nigeria — this government. It is the worst and in fact it is like a curse. “I have been here for some time and I led the first prayer and fasting for Nigeria in 1979. I am not a baby in the affairs of Nigeria. This is the worst government, a government with no direction. Their days are numbered. I can tell you as a prophet that their days are numbered.”
