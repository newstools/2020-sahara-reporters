 The Presidential Task Force on Coronavirus on Tuesday moved round most sections of Aso Villa in Abuja in order to gather facts on the possible spread of the virus. This comes shortly after it emerged that Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, tested positive for the virus. SaharaReporters had on Monday exclusively reported that Kyari was seriously ill and suspected of having Coronavirus after returning from trips to Germany and Egypt where the virus had killed dozens of persons in recent weeks. During Tuesday’s tour by members of the task force, it was observed that Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, was not in his office, sparking speculations that he may have resorted to self-isolation especially after attending meetings with Kyari since his return from the foreign trips. Kyari and Osinbajo often seat close to each other during the weekly Federal Executive Council meetings inside Aso Villa. To prevent a further spread of the virus inside the Presidential Villa, activities have been shut down while all staff and in fact all those, who came in contact with Kyari had been asked to self-isolate for a number of days in a bid to curtail the spread of the deadly virus. Nigeria currently has 42 confirmed cases of Coronavirus with one death recorded so far.
