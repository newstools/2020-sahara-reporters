 A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has granted an interim order releasing the deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, from house arrest. Justice Anwuli Chikere granted the order in line with the prayers of the ex-parte motion filed on behalf of Sanusi by his lawyer, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN). Fagbemi and other Senior Advocates of Nigeria filed a lawsuit to challenge Sanusi’s banishment to Nasarawa State at the Federal High Court in Abuja. Kano State Executive Council approved Sanusi’s dethronement at a special sitting held on Monday. Since coming on the throne, Sanusi, who rose to become governor of Nigeria’s Central Bank as a professional, has always spoken out against harmful traditions and practices in the North, often times drawing the ire of elites in the region. He has been banished to a town named Awe in Nasarawa State where he is expected to live quietly with his family.
