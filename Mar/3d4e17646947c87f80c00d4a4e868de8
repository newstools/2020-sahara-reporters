"Effective from Tuesday 24th March 2020, all regular and non-essential activities will be suspended in its headquarters and offices nation-wide for 14 days in the first instance. "The regular quarterly meetings with stakeholders including political parties, civil society organisations, the media, security agencies and all other meetings, have been suspended until such a time when normalcy returns. "The commission will no longer monitor the conventions, congresses, conferences or meetings of political parties until further notice," Okoye said.
