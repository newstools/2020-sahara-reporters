  Deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, won’t have access to visitors while on exile, the Kano State Government has announced. Director-General, Media and Communications for the state government, Salihu Yakasai, made the disclosure in a post on Twitter on Monday. He said, “Clearly, some people are ignorant of how dethronement works. When an Emir is dethroned, he is sent on exile in a remote location and will basically be under house arrest and won’t have access to visitors. “A person under these circumstances will be after his freedom and not the next election.” Since coming on the throne, Sanusi, who rose to become Governor of Nigeria’s Central Bank as a professional, has always spoken out against harmful traditions and practices in the North, often times drawing the ire of elites in the region. The executive council headed by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano claimed that Sanusi was removed for displaying disregard for laid down rules.
