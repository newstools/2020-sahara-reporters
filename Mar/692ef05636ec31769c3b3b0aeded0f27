BusinessDay Media  Deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has been moved from Loko in Nasarawa State where he was initially banished to and now taken to Awe also in the same state. Head of Loko town, Abubakar Sabo, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday that Sanusi “has been relocated from my domain”. He said, “The Emir of Kano left my domain around 1:40pm. "I don’t know where they have taken him to. They came with a helicopter and took him away. He has left.” Kano State Executive Council approved the dethronement of Sanusi at a special sitting held on Monday. Since coming on the throne, Sanusi, who rose to become governor of Nigeria’s Central Bank as a professional, has always spoken out against harmful traditions and practices in the North, often times drawing the ire of elites in the region. The executive council headed by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano claimed that Sanusi was removed for displaying disregard for laid down rules.
