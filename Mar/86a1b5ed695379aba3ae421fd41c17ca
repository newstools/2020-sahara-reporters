  Wife of the Canadian Prime Minister, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, has tested positive for Coronavirus. According to Reuters, this was disclosed by a spokesman for the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. The Prime Minister had earlier shared via his Twitter handle that his wife had developed cold and she was in isolation until her test result was out. He said, “I have some personal news to share today. Sophie recently returned from a speaking event in the United Kingdom and last night she was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. She‘s feeling better, but following the advice of our doctor, she is self-isolating as we wait on COVID-19 test results. “Out of an abundance of caution, I too will be self-isolating and self-monitoring until we get Sophie‘s results back. "But I‘ll be busy working from home. I‘ll be speaking with some world leaders and joining ministers for a cabinet committee discussion on COVID-19. “I was looking forward to sitting down with premiers and indigenous leaders but given the circumstances, we‘ll be postponing our meeting. In the meantime, we‘ll speak on the phone about how we can mitigate the spread and impact of COVID-19 and keep Canadians safe.”
