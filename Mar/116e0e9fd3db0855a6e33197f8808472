 Following the lockdown order issued by the Nigerian Government, workers providing essential services like healthcare, food and medical supplies at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport in Abuja, are crying out over the porous preventive measures within the facility. A staff of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency at the airport told SaharaReporters that authorities were exposing them to the risk of contracting Coronavirus as a result of the lack of effective preventive measures at the place. “Government and the airport authority need to step up safety and preventive measures for us so that we don’t contract this infectious disease because we are serving the country. “For example, the hand sanitisers they brought last week, which was placed at a particular entrance for people to use, finished within two days and is yet to be replaced since then even though people have been working daily within the facility. “The condition is worse in some other departments in the airport but people are scared to talk. “We are too exposed and this is very dangerous and bad,” the source said. Three other workers at the airport, who spoke with SaharaReporters, also expressed worry that the situation if not immediately checked could expose them to the virus. President Muhammadu Buhari had in a broadcast on Sunday ordered a 14-day lockdown of Lagos, Ogun and Abuja in order to boost government’s effort at curtailing the spread of Coronavirus in the country. Nigeria currently has 111 confirmed cases of the virus and one recorded death.
