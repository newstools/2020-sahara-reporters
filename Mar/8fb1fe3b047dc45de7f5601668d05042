  Dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has filed a lawsuit to challenge his banishment to Nasarawa State at the Federal High Court in Abuja According to the PUNCH, the legal battle is being led by 12 Senior Advocates of Nigeria. The SANs have filed ex parte application seeking an interim order for his release had been assigned to Justice Anwuli Chikere. On Monday, the dethroned monarch was banished to Loko, a remote location in Nasarawa State. On Tuesday,  he was relocated to Awe, where he is currently being detained at a house. These all happened within 24 hours after he was dethroned. The respondents to the application are the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu; Director-General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi; Attorney-General of Kano State, Ibrahim Muktar, and Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN). In the application, which is a prelude to the main suit, the deposed monarch  specifically prayed for an interim order for the restoration of his rights to human dignity, personal liberty, freedom of association, and movement around Nigeria, apart from Kano State, pending the hearing and determination of his main suit. “An interim order of this honourable court releasing the applicant from the detention and or confinement of the respondents and restoring the applicant’s rights to human dignity, personal liberty, freedom of association and movement in Nigeria, (apart from Kano State) pending the hearing and determination of the applicant’s originating summons,” the prayer read in part. Alleging a breach of their client’s rights provided under sections 34,35, 40, 41 and 46 of the Nigerian constitution, Sanusi’s legal team contended, “the applicant’s fundamental right to life, human dignity, personal liberty and movement are seriously under challenge and continually being breached by the respondents.” In addition to the interim order, the lawyers sought an order granting leave to the applicant to serve the order to be issued by the court and the main suit on the four respondents through substituted means. He prayed for an order permitting him to deliver the processes meant for the IGP to any officer in his office at the police headquarters at Louis Edet House, Garki, Abuja, the ones for the DG DSS to any officer at the DSS headquarters at Aso Drive in Abuja, the ones for the AG of Kano State to any officer at state’s Ministry of Justice, Audu Bako Secretariat, Kano, and the ones for the AGF to any officer at the Federal Ministry of Justice in Abuja. His grounds for the application are, “The applicant’s originating motion and all other processes were filed on March 12, 2020. “Considering the status of the respondents, it would be difficult to effect personal service on the first second and third respondents (IGP, DG of DSS), unless this application is granted. “First, second and third respondents will have knowledge of the originating motion for the enforcement of the applicant’s fundamental right, if they are served by substituted means as stated on the motion paper. “There is an urgent need to grant this application so that service can be promptly effected on the first, second and third respondents. “Applicant’s fundamental rights to life, human dignity, personal liberty and movement are seriously under challenge and continually being breached by the respondents.”
