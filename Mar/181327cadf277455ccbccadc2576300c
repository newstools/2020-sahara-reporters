 All professional football activities in Nigeria have been suspended for 28 days to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the country. This announcement was made by the Nigeria Football Federation on Wednesday. This comes a few days after an exclusive report by SaharaReporters exposing how professional football league venues across Nigeria lacked basic precautionary items like hand sanitisers and face masks to protect players and fans from Coronavirus. The report also exposed the lack of ambulances and medical personnel at most match venues to attend to emergency health cases.
