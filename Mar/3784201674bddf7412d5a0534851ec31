  The Lagos State House of Assembly on Thursday lifted the suspension of two lawmakers, Moshood Oshun and Raheem Kazeem. Speaker of the Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, made the announcement at the start of plenary on Thursday. According to Obasa, the Governor's Advisory Council and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, called a meeting earlier in the week to intervene in the matter. Recall that aside the suspension of the two members, two other principal officers, Olumuyiwa Jimoh and Rotimi Abiru, who were the former Deputy Majority Leader and the Chief Whip respectively, were relieved of their duties. SaharaReporters had exclusively reported that Obasa suspended the lawmakers to quash allegations of corruption against him. Obasa through companies he owned and directly benefits from had been issuing contracts to himself, an act that is against the public service rule of Nigeria. SaharaReporters had published a list of companies the Speaker had been using to award contracts to himself and launder public funds. To avoid it being directly linked to him, Obasa did not use his name to register but used his father, wife and children as shareholders in the company. Some of the companies are Adesav International Ventures, Quick Solution International Ventures, White Honey Enterprises, Cream on Ice Services, A.B DELCO Nigeria Company, and Fabric Splash Ventures. Others are Skye-Macosh Company, Swifthill International Ventures, Silver Section Global, Davedab Global Ventures and Jose Macosh Company.
