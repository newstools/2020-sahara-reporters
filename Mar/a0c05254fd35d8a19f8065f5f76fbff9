  The Lagos State Government has asked public officers to stay at home for 14 daysÂ as part of measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the country. The stay-at-home order affects officers from Grade level 1 to 12. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu gave the order on Sunday during a statewide address. Nigeria has recorded 28 confirmed cases of the pandemic, raising fears of a further spread.
