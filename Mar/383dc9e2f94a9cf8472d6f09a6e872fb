 Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has said that many Nigerians are not supporting the government in the fight against Coronavirus. The minister said this at a press conference on Thursday in Abuja. He said, "Let me say without mincing words that we are not getting the kind of cooperation that this moment deserves from Nigerians. "Many are busy engaging in meaningless criticisms instead of complying with the stipulated directives to keep people safe. "Some Nigerians who flew into the country from overseas filled wrong addresses and phone numbers in their forms, making it difficult to trace them when the need arises. "Some Nigerians defied orders to stay away from large gatherings while some religious leaders willfully flouted the directives to ensure social distancing. "The government is doing its best but we need the citizens to do their best too. "We have now gone past the stage of persuasion. It's time for strong enforcement." Mohammed also announced that the Nigerian Government might be forced to announce even stiffer measures to control the spread of Coronavirus in the country. He added, "The truth is that time is running out. If we don't urgently and more aggressively enforce the measures I have just listed, we have a short window within which to stop this pandemic or face an explosion in terms of the cases. We cannot afford to be complacent. "In view of this, we are considering tougher measures to enforce compliance, stop the exportation of the disease to states that do not have it and minimise spread. "Possible measures include stopping inter-state/inter-town travels, except for essential services, closing all motor parks and inter-state rail stations. "We will be considering and announcing new measures from time to time, but rest assured that whatever decisions we take will be in the best I nterest of Nigerians."
