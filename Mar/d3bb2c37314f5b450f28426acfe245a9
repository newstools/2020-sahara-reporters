At least about seven trucks, armoured tanks and water cannons were stationed outside the APC headquarters in Abuja when our correspondent visited the place on Wednesday evening. A group of protesters were also sighted around the building but their mission was not known as at the time of this report. The police, who arrived the scene, asked those not staff of the secretariat to vacate the building, leading to confusion and panic in the area.
