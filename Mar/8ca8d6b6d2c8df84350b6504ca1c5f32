 The Lagos State Government has set up food banks across the state to cater for 200,000 households in 377 wards in the state to cater for the most vulnerable during the mandated lockdown to curb the spread of Coronavirus. Residents, who cannot afford meals during the lockdown will receive food provided by the state.
