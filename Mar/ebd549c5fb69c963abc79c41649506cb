SOC Okenwa The (dis)Honourable Speaker of the Nigerian House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, is the fourth man in the constitutional hierarchy. That is, he is the fourth most powerful man in Nigeria right behind the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, and the President, Muhammadu Buhari. Since power intoxicates in 'Naija' politicians covet power and authority deploying every means imaginable, legitimate or illegitimate, to attain their objectives. Besides, given the lucrative nature of political business in our embattled country there could be no other venture as rewarding as politics. Speaker Gbajabiamila's academic brilliance is not in any doubt whatsoever. He possesses a rich educational background and delivers his speeches eloquently. But his past sojourn in the United States of America poses a problem that cannot be swept under the carpet for partisan politics' sake. He belongs to the ruling APC party and therefore connected to the system that dehumanises us all. He is a Lagosian and therefore a 'student' of Asiwaju godfatherism. Of course, he owed his speakership position to his closeness and loyalty to the Tinubu organized gang in Lagos.When he was vying for the speakership of the lower federal legislative chamber, his inglorious fraudulent past surfaced and featured online but he went ahead to clinch the top job despite the protestations from opposition elements. Pray, how could someone capable of altering his identity be allowed to vie for and occupy a national office? Where were the DSS agents during the electoral process? Or they were busy chasing after journalists and the opponents of Buhari and co?
