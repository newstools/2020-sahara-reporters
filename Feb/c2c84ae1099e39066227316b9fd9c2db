Buhari, who returned from Ethiopia after attending the African Union summit, decided to visit Borno following an attack by Boko Haram terrorists, which left at least 30 persons dead. However, as the President’s convoy drove through the city, he was met with boos and angry chants from residents of Maiduguri, the state capital.
