  Members of the African Action Congress, Take It Back Movement, #RevolutionNow Movement and a handful of other groups on Tuesday took to the streets of Abuja in a solidarity walk to express support for Amnesty International. The move was occasioned by an earlier protest by a sponsored thugs, who had stormed AI’s office to condemn its work in Nigeria. However, members of AAC and others supporting Amnesty International, say they want the organisation to continue with its work of upholding human rights and constitutional democracy in the country. The group said it will continue to support AI to promote citizens’ freedom in every ramification. An official of the global human rights organisation in Abuja told SaharaReporters that, “This (hired thugs) normally occurs whenever Amnesty International is about to release factual reports of issues affecting Nigerians especially the abuse of power and human rights violations by the Nigerian Government. “The government doesn’t want to see those kinds of report, they don't want Nigerian citizens to know about them.”
