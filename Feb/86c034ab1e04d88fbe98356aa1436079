Security has been beefed up at the Supreme Court Abuja ahead of the sitting by a panel of judges to review itsÂ judgments in the governorship cases in Imo and Zamfara states. Armed security operatives have been stationed at the strategic positions at the court premises to maintain law and order. Staff, journalists and visitors were subjected to thorough checks and screening before gaining entry. Armoured Personnel Carrier and police water canon trucks have been stationed at the main gate to nip in the bud any possible protest by party supporters. There is tension in both camps of the All Progressives Congress and Peoples Democratic Party as no one can predict where the pendulum will swing. Supporters of both parties were denied access into the premises of the court. Recall that Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP was sacked by the apex court on January 14 as governor of Imo State, creating room for Hope Uzodinma of the APC to emerge. Ihedioha had on February 5, 2020 approached the court for a review of the ruling.
