  The Federal Capital Territory Administration has said it would begin to prosecute and also publish names of traffic offenders on television and in newspapers. The FCTA Permanent Secretary, Christian Ohaa, said this had become necessary to curb the high rate of accidents caused by traffic violations. Ohaa said, “Following recurring incidence of traffic violations resulting to multiple accidents, the Federal Capital Territory Administration wishes to inform residents of FCT that starting from Monday February 17, 2020, all traffic violators irrespective of status and office will be prosecuted on the spot by the FCT mobile court and they will be named and shamed on television and newspapers. “Residents of the FCT are enjoined to be law-abiding always.”
