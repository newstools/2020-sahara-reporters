Director, Administration of NSCIA, Mr Yusuf Nwoha, made the call while speaking at a news conference on the state of the nation in Abuja. Nwoha said that the security situation in the country requires desperate measures in the collective interest of all Nigerians. He said, “Let the monster of insecurity be tackled actively and proactively with the full weight of Nigeria’s security and defence capabilities.” He stressed that the activities of Boko Haram insurgents were completely against the principles and teachings of Islam.
