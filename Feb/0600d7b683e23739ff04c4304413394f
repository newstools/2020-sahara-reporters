National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has written to the  Independent National Election Commission to demand a fresh governorship election in Bayelsa state. Deputy National Chairman of the party, Yekini Nabena, disclosed this at a press briefing in Abuja. The Supreme Court sacked David Lyon as winner of the 2019 election in the state and ordered the commission to wear in the next party with the second highest votes. The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Douye Diri, was subsequently sworn in. He said, “The party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, while affirming the supremacy of the Apex Court, forwarded a letter to INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, titled: Judgment in Appeal No: SC.1/2020 between Peoples Democratic Party and APC, requesting for the conduct of fresh governorship election in Bayelsa. “When the Supreme Court decided against the PDP on the Imo governorship poll, the party in protest by its National Chairman, Uche Secondus, went around the European Union, UK and US embassies wailing that ‘Nigeria’s democracy was under threat. “What has suddenly changed in the case of the Bayelsa governorship election? “This only goes to show that these foreign concerns and all Nigerians must be wary of such politics and insincere antics of the PDP. “The contention on the Bayelsa governorship is far from over. We are all aware of the NYSC certificate forgery case of the Bayelsa deputy governor, Lawrence Oborawharievwo Ewhrudjakpo. “And the decision of the APC National leadership to continue to pursue all legal avenues to contest INEC’s decision to declare Douye Diri as Bayelsa governor, having failed to meet the mandatory constitutional requirement to become governor.”
