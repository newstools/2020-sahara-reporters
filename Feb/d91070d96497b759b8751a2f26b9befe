  A director in one of the hospitals in Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, has died from the virus. The director, Liu Zhiming, died on Monday, according to local media reports from China. The death toll has risen to 72,436 infections and 1,868 deaths with new infected patients being admitted daily. More health workers treating patients of the virus have been reported sick from the virus. The World Health Organisation said on Monday that the number of new coronavirus infections in China appeared to be declining though it was too early to tell if the reported decline would continue. China’s renowned epidemiologist, Zhong Nanshan, said he expected the outbreak to peak by middle-to-late February, later than initially estimated, according to Southern Metropolis Daily. Mr Zhong said he expected the situation to be “stable” by the end of April. Cities continued to tighten their restrictions meant to curb the spread of the virus. Beijing on Monday cordoned off its hutongs, traditional alleyways in the centre of the city, with community members restricting non-residents’ access. The Beijing International Automobile Exhibition, which was supposed to take place from April 21 to April 30, has been postponed due to the outbreak, the organisers said in a statement.
