  Nigeria’s main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, has told President Muhammadu Buhari that the booing he received from aggrieved residents of Maiduguri, Borno State, during his visit to the city on Wednesday was confirmation of the loss of confidence in his administration. The party also stated that it was a clear message to Buhari that Nigerians considered him responsible for the rising spate of insecurity in the country. In a statement by the party’s spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP said, “The booing of President Buhari in Borno State is a clear message to him that Nigerians hold him responsible for the escalated insecurity in the country. “We call on President Buhari to go beyond his sympathy visit to Borno state and take decisive steps to end the killings in that state and other parts of the country.
