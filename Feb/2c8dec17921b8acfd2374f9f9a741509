 Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, has described the prosecution of Omoyele Sowore as a waste of time and the nation's resources. Soyinka, who spoke during an interview session with Plus TV Africa, alsoÂ slammed Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, saying he had committed a lot of blunders in his administration. Speaking on the ongoing prosecution of Sowore by the government for calling for a peaceful protest, he lamented that the government was wasting the nation's resources to prosecute the case. He also condemned the bail conditions Sowore was admitted to, which includes his confinement to Abuja even though Sowore had no place of residence in that city. He said, "I don't understand why this young man is being barricaded in one city that is not his own with very stringent bail conditions and the whole exercise, this is punitive and petulant. "The case is time-wasting and person-wasting and also wasting the time of lawyers who could be attending to far more serious cases. "Definitely, time-wasting and wasting of public expenses and attention on serious issues." Soyinka, who was at the court to witness the trial last week, berated the prosecuting team for displaying lack of readiness to get done with the matter. He added, "The prosecution was obviously not prepared to move on after this long adjournment and to see the fireworks they have in their stock but we didn't, I can't understand this nonsense." Soyinka described Buhari as one, who wakes up late to happenings in the country.
