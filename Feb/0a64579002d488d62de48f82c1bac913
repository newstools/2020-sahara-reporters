 A 24-year old activist and student of Psychology at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Aniefiok Ekerete Johnson, is missing. Aniefiok went missing along with three of his friends, Akaniyene Akpan, Stanley Isaac Ikono and Iduehe Johnson. They are yet to be found despite a petition to the police. According to their families, the four were last seen on December 1, 2019 at 5:30pm. Johnson’s family said the Akwa Ibom State Police Command had refused to make any intervention nor attempted to search for the missing students. They lamented that despite sending a petition to the Commissioner of Police in Akwa Ibom State, Mr Kenneth Ebrimson, informing him of the situation, he had not made any move even after acknowledging the receipt of the petition. They also claimed that the police had not reacted more than one month after submitting it and demanding the safe return of the missing persons. In the petition sent to the Akwa Ibom State Police Command dated December 30, 2019 and sighted by our correspondent, Johnson’s family pleaded to the police to help search for the missing son. The petition reads, “Aniefiok Ekerete Johnson was last seen 07:30hrs on December 1, 2019 with three other friends (all students too) who are also missing. “Efforts to trace his whereabouts through schoolmate, neighbours and some security agencies have proved abortive. “Details of the missing Ekerete Johnson and the three other friends are Anjefiok Ekerete Johnson: (08127496823, 09029264877); Akaniyene Akpan (08171114886); Stanley Isaac Ikono (08126443284); and Nduehe Johnson (08024617630). “It is our hope that you will your good offices into seeing that these missing individuals are found, and returned back safely.”
