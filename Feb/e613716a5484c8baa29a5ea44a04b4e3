Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari would not heed the demand of some Nigerians and sack security chiefs in the country. In the wake of renewed attacks by Boko Haram terrorist, Nigerians have urged President Buhari to sack service chiefs in the country and inject some fresh blood into the security apparatus. Addressing journalists in Abuja, Mustapha said that Buhari couldn’t sack service chiefs as there are processes to be followed. He added that there are some people fuelling the destabilisation of the country. Mustapha urged Nigerians to unite and also cooperate with the military in fighting insurgency in the country. He said, “We are in a very difficult time now. We need everybody to be on board. We need synergy within an intelligent community, within the military formations that will help fight this war. “You don’t sack people like that. There are processes and I believe that at the opportune time, those processes will be followed. “You don’t just wake up and say sack people, it doesn’t happen like that. “What government wants is for everybody to be on the same page, fight the battle of securing the nation for protecting lives and property and ensuring that every Nigerian has the opportunity to live a prosperous life. I think that should be our main focus.”
