Electricity consumers in Ondo State on Monday took to the streets of Akure, the capital, to protest lack of power supply and estimated billing by officials of Benin Electricity Distribution Company. The protesters, mostly landlords and business owners from the Alagbaka area of Akure, also complained over the extortion of residents by the electricity company. The protestors stormed the head office of the BEDC in Akure, chanting solidarity songs and preventing workers from gaining entry into the complex. One of the protesters, Mr Olujimi Oluseye, observed that the total blackout in their area and the Akure metropolis had negatively affected economic and commercial activities. He explained how landlords and some community elders in the Elekumo area of Alagbaka had made several efforts to have BEDC officials address the issue without luck. Oluseye said, "Our demands are very simple; we are saying no to estimated bills without electricity supply in the Alagbaka extension area and Akure as a whole. "We have complained but they refused to listen and you would see them bringing bills. "Some of the metres (pre-paid) they are giving us are not being installed and not even working. “We call on the authorities of BEDC to do the needful and if nothing is done, we shall take the matter to court." Mr. Ademola Abisoye, another protester, noted that many of the houses in the area were given estimated monthly bills of N40,000 without electricity supply. He called on the federal government to revoke the operating license of the BEDC before Nigerians revolt. Business Manager, Akure Unit of the BEDC, Mr Andrew Okoye, told SaharaReporters that the company was aware of all the issues raised by the protesters and promised that the matter would be address soon.
