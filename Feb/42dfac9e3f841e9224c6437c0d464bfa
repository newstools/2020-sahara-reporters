  Former Super Eagles captain, Joseph Yobo, has been appointed by the Nigeria Football Federation as assistant coach of the country’s national men’s soccer team. The ex-Everton of England and Fenerbahce of Turkey defender replaces Imama Amapakabo in the team’s technical crew. Yobo joins the coaching crew led by Gernot Rohr as the team prepares for the African Cup of Nations qualify in the coming weeks. The Rivers State-born footballer joins a list of ex-internationals that went on to become part of the Super Eagles coaching crew after successful playing careers. The 39-year-old represented Nigeria in six Africa Cup of Nations finals – 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2013, leading the team to glory in 2013 in South Africa where the Super Eagles under the late Stephen Keshi conquered the continent for the third time.
