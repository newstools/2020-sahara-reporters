  Father of suspected suicide bomber arrested at the Living Faith Church, a.k.a Winners’ Chapel in Kaduna, says his son is a Christian. There has been hot debate over the religious inclination of the man. Initial reports claimed that his name was Muhammad Sani, a Muslim name common amongst the Northerners. However, in a video that has now gone viral, the man said his name was Nathaniel Samuel. The father, Samuel Ezekiel, has now confirmed that his son was indeed a Christian and goes by the name Nathaniel Samuel. “No! Not even for a single day has he been a Muslim,” Nathaniel’s father said. According to Daily Trust, the father along with the Kaduna State Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria, Reverend Joseph Hayab, found otherwise. Nathaniel was born in 1991 and schooled in the state, his father said. His mother is from Nasarawa State even though she no longer lives with them. Ezekiel said his son has been a Christian and not a Muslim even for a single day. He denied that his son bears Mohammed Sani. Ezekiel also said he was shocked when he was told that his son carried a bomb into a church because he wondered what would have happened to the lives of people in the church. “If he was alone, I don’t care but for the lives that are in the church, I begin to wonder. I shed tears,” he said. Reverend Hayab Joseph said he knew the father of the suspect for many years, noting that it’s just that he didn’t know that Nathaniel was the son of Ezekiel until he visited the house. He said CAN is not concerned about Nathaniel’s name or religion but the act of criminality that he would have committed which should be addressed. He also expressed disappointment over the failure of the police to do a thorough check on the suspect’s background, saying that would have saved Nigerians a lot of stress on the identity of the suspect.
