 The autopsy report conducted on the remains of slain journalist, Alex Ogbu, has shown that he was killed by a bullet, contrary to claims by police authorities that the victim died after hitting his head on a stone. The autopsy report obtained by SaharaReporters on Saturday, was conducted at the National Hospital, Abuja. The document indicated  'brain evisceration' as direct cause of his death. Brain evisceration is an injury to the skull caused by a high-velocity bullet.

SaharaReporters had reported that Ogbu was shot in the head by a policeman while covering a protest by members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria on January 21, 2020. In an attempt to cover up the incident, policemen, who took the victim's body to the mortuary, told attendants there that Ogbu was an accident victim.
