  The Christian Association of Nigeria has called on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos to stop illegal entry into the state in order to curb insecurity. This was just as the Christian body expressed support for the policy of the state government to ban motorcycles and tricycles. Rev. Supo Ayokunle, President of CAN, who spoke at the Inter-Denominational Divine Service on Saturday, said the policy was a right step in the right direction as he claimed that some terrorists operate with motorbikes and have the tendency to unleash terror in different communities. Ayokunle called on Governor Sanwo-Olu to ensure he "monitors the ports in the state to prevent illegal entry of ammunition and safeguard the lives of the citizenry. "It is the same Okada Boko Haram use to bomb places and run around. You cannot close your eyes to the security and welfare of the people. It is not about politics but about human lives. Be bold the city is behind you, we are wiser now." AyokunleÂ urged Sanwo-Olu to provide cabs and boats as alternatives for Lagos residents. Sanwo-Olu in his speech thanked CAN for organising prayer and thanksgiving service for the state and nation. He stated that the railway system was underway in the state, adding that his administration would focus on good governance. He said, "Let us continue to understand that we are one another's keeper. Even if things are hard it will be for a short while because better days are coming in our state. "The state is going through a level of infrastructural transformation that will be to the benefit of all of us in transportation, road rehabilitation, education and other spheres."
