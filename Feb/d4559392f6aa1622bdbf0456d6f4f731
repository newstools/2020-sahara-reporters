  President Muhammadu Buhari has visited Maiduguri, capital of Borno State, on a sympathy visit following the rising spate of killings by Boko Haram insurgents in the city. On Sunday, over 30 travellers were attacked and killed just about 25 kilometres from Maiduguri. Several vehicles were also destroyed in the process by the terrorists. Buhari arrived the volatile city straight from Ethiopia where he had attended the African Union summit and also signed bilateral agreements with the countryâ€™s Prime Minister. In recent times, Maiduguri and other parts of Borno have witnessed increased Boko Haram attacks leading to dozens of deaths and displacement of residents.
