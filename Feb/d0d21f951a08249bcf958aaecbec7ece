 Tukur Yusuf Buratai, Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff, has finally reacted to the call for the sack of service chiefs. Nigerians have been calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the service chiefs in light of the growing insecurity in the country. In a recent interview, Buratai urged the President not to be pressured into sacking service chiefs. He said sacking the security heads would not solve the problem, adding that the President knows what the issues are. He said, “I am tempted not to comment on this particular issue because I am directly involved. "However, I want to believe that whatever happens, the commander-in-chief is the right arbiter, and he knows where it pinches, he knows where the problems are. I think the decision should be left to him. He should not be pushed or prompted in this regard.” Speaking further, Buratai said the Boko Haram insurgency was at a phase where everyone, including lawmakers must collectively work together to end the terror reign. He said, "This is why when you say a particular crop of leaders in the military should be removed for whatever reason, it sounds very odd because we are not addressing the issues. "I am not saying this because I am the Chief of Army Staff and I do not want to leave. No, that is not the issue. It is beyond that because this is a national issue, an issue of national pride and national interest. "Those who would cry loudly against the service chiefs are within, and they are the ones who should be more vocal in the things that are not going right.”
