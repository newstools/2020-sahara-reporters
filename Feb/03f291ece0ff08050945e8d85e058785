  The Borno State Government has reopened the Maiduguri-Dikwa Road five years after it was closed due to killings by Boko Haram terrorists in the region. Governor of the state, Babagana Zulum, said the reopening of the road would resuscitate socio-economic activities, especially fishing businesses crippled in the Lake Chad region. He explained that motorists traveling on the road would move freely to their destinations without military escort following improved security. Zulum stated that the government was also consulting with the military to ensure that travellers on the Ngala and Kala Balge roads moved without being extorted. He said, “Everybody in Borno is aware of what is going on the highways. It is not something new and our presence here is not to vindicate anybody. “The Nigerian law does not prohibit the transportation of goods within the state. So therefore, you cannot ask a driver to pay money for transporting sachet water anywhere within the state. “How can you transport pure water and tomatoes and you are asked to pay N19, 000 for a six-tyre vehicle. “This government and the people will fight to see an end these activities in Borno.”
