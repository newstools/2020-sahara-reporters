  The Agbor Central Hospital under Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State, has concluded plans to bury 300 unclaimed corpses said to have been abandoned in the hospital’s morgue. According to the management of the hospital, the mortuary originally designed to around 60 corpses was now littered with uncollected corpses by families. Making the disclosure on Tuesday, Zonal Medical Director of the hospital, Roy Maduka, expressed sadness over the situation, saying that there were currently over 600 corpses at the facility. While appealing to the state government for the establishment of a modern mortuary, Maduka said the regular power supply enjoyed at the hospital at the moment was as a result of the acquisition and installation of a 33KVA transformer by the state government. He said, "This will help in easing the current practice of just embalming of dead bodies deposited at the mortuary. “The mortuary is old and relies on embalming of bodies. The building was constructed to take about 50-60 bodies at a time. “Currently, we have over 600 corpses in the small space. Over half of the bodies are unknown/abandoned corpses. We are currently making plans to conduct a mass burial for the unknown corpses. "Plans are also being made to build a holding place for the abandoned corpses for a period of time before mass burial can be conducted.”
