A documentary produced by the 44th United States President, Barack Obama, and his wife, Michelle, has won the award for best documentary at the 92nd Oscars. The documentary, American Factory, is the first Academy Award for the Obamas’ production company, Higher Ground. The former president and first lady weren’t able to attend the ceremony, which took place in Hollywood on Sunday. The award was accepted by the film’s Co-directors, Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert. Accepting the award, Reichert said, “Working people have it harder and harder these days — and we believe that things will get better when workers of the world unite.” Michelle Obama sent her congratulations, tweeting, “The best stories are rarely tidy or perfect. But that’s where the truth so often lies. “Congrats to Julia, Steven, and the whole crew on winning Best Documentary for #AmericanFactory, Higher Ground's first release. "So glad to see their heart and honesty recognised."
