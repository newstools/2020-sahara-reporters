 Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja, has struck out the seven-count charge previously brought  against human rights activists, Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare, by the Nigerian Government at the ongoing trial on Thursday. The move follows the amended charges filed against them by the government. The prosecution had earlier on Wednesday dropped charges bothering on money laundering, terrorism and cyberstalking President Muhammadu Buhari against Sowore.  The activists pleaded not guilty when the fresh charge of attempting to bring down Buhari’s government through revolution was read to them.
