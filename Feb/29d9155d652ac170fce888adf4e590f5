 The Northern Elders Forum has said that President Muhammadu Buhari has failed in the leadership of Nigeria. Director, Advocacy and Engagements of the group, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, during a briefing with journalists in Kaduna on Sunday, said they were disappointed at the way Buhari was running the affairs of Nigeria. Baba-Ahmed said, “The forum demands a thorough overhaul of the leadership of our security and public safety agencies, and the injection of higher levels of competence, integrity and accountability in the manner our troops and the police and security agencies deal with security challenges. “The forum regrets that by any standard of judgment, the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari has failed the nation in the vital area of improving its security. Poverty, particularly in the North, and massive social security have worsened under this administration. “The relationship between insecurity and poverty is fundamental, but the administration does not appear to have any idea on what will provide relief or solution. “It is shocking that in spite of unprecedented consensus among Nigerians that the administration requires a new resolve, approach and leadership in the fight against the nation’s multiple security challenges, President Buhari appears either totally isolated or in deep denial over the result of his failures to secure Nigerians. “With this type of mindset, it is difficult to see how President Buhari can accept the challenge to radically improve his handling of our security situation. “Nonetheless, we believe that Nigerians must continue to raise our voices and organise through all legitimate means to demand that the administration address major failings in his perception of our situation and his response to our demands for our rights to security.”
