  Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, has been suspended for six months by Traditional Rulersâ€™ Council in Osun State. His suspension followed an emergency meeting of top monarchs across the state including the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, in Osogbo, the capital. A committee headed by Orangun of Ila, Oba Wahab Adedotun, was also set up to further investigate the assault case involving Oluwo and another monarch in Iwo land.
