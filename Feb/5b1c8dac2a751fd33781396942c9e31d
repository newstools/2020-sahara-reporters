 Facts have emerged on how the International Criminal Police Organisation arrested a Nigerian Army personnel, Major Akeem Oseni, in Cotonou, Republic of Benin, after he fled Nigeria following his conviction for the killing of Lance Corporal Collins Benjamin on Feb 23, 2017. The victim died after being tortured by Oseni in conjunction with Ogbemudia Osawe, Nuhu Dogary and Captain S. Amosu at a football pitch in Mogadishu Cantonment, Abuja. While Amosu was eventually found innocent of the offence by a general court-martial that sat at the Army Headquarters in Abuja on February 7, 2020, Oseni, Osawe and Dogary were all found guilty and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment each for Benjamin’s death. The accused officers were charged for manslaughter punishable under Section 105 of the AFA Cap A20 lFN 2004. However, shortly after the verdict was passed, Oseni disappeared into thin air after taking excuse to use the toilet while being led to the office of a senior military officer inside the Mogadishu Cantonment, Captain J. Akwaraonwu, at about 7:48pm on Friday. A thorough search was carried out within and outside the cantonment premises but the accused officer was nowhere to be found. He was finally arrested at the Cotonou Airport at about 11:55am on Monday morning by the Interpol. Findings by SaharaReporters revealed that Amosu may not be unconnected with Oseni’s disappearance to Cotonou as according to a top military source, he was the one, who organised the major’s initial escape. However, Osawe and Dogary are currently under custody pending further action by Army Council headed by Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd).
