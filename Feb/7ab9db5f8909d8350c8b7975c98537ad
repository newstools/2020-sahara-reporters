 Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of adding to the transportation crisis in Lagos State. The lawyer said the President cancelled the $200m metroline contract that could have improved transportation in the state significantly. He said, “We had paid $200m and there was a penalty that if the contract was cancelled, Nigeria would pay colossally. "We were dragged to arbitration, I don’t remember the figure now, but we were fined. So, metroline, we don’t have; money we have lost and inconvenience has continued since then. “So, we also have a right, if we are organised in a civilised manner, to demand from the Abuja people, ‘You must pay back the cost of that metro line that you cancelled; so that we can restore it.”
