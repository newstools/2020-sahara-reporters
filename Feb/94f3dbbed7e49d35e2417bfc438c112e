A technical firm, KariCare Nigeria Limited, has called on the federal and state governments to invest more in technical education across the country in order to equip young Nigerians with relevant skills to create jobs and earn decent living. Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Daere Akobo, who made the call during the inauguration of the organisation in Lagos, bemoaned how unskilled technicians were subjecting Nigerians to all forms of horror including fire accidents as a result of their lack of expertise. Akobo called for the amendment of the Nigeria’s education curriculum to accommodate more technical schools and institutes where artisans and other unskilled workers could be properly groomed for the country’s development. He said, “Technical education is the future of Nigeria’s development and that is why we are calling on government at the federal and state level to invest heavily in this area. “Being a key player in that sector and seeing how well technical skills can create jobs and provide sources of livelihoods for individuals and households, we have no doubt that investment in this area will create more wealth for Nigeria. “As a result of the lack of skilled technicians, the society is recording a lot of hazards including fire outbreaks and other accidents caused by quackery. “As an organisation, we will continue to partner relevant stakeholders in the country to train individuals on technical skills and help create employment in the process.” President Muhammadu Buhari had proposed N48bn for capital projects for the Ministry of Education in the 2020 appropriation bill he submitted to the National Assembly in October 2019. According to experts in the sector, the amount is grossly inadequate in providing badly needed infrastructure and equipment in the country’s 43 federal universities, over 25 federal polytechnics, 21 federal colleges of education and 104 federal unity schools under the funding of the ministry.
