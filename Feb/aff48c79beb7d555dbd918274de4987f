 The Northern Elders Forum has again reminded President Muhammadu Buhari on the need to sweep out insurgency from the North. Director of Advocacy and Engagement of the forum, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said victims of Boko Haram insurgency were everywhere in the North particularly in Borno and Yobe. He also warned the President to desist from blaming others for the attacks in the region. It was reported that President Buhari had said the attacks in Borno State could not have happened without the knowledge of the elders. Reacting to this, Baba-Ahmed said, “These are not times for blame game. Every level of society in most of the North-East, especially in Borno and Yobe states, have been victim of this insurgency. “Perhaps, President Buhari was unaware that there are many places where citizens have been particularly vulnerable, and this place of attack has been a position of major concern for quite a while because the gate is closed in the night to everyone’s knowledge."
