Nigerians have continued to react to Thursday's Supreme Court judgment, which nullified the emergence of All Progressives Congress candidate, David Lyon, as winner of the November 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State. The apex court went on to declare candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Diri Douye, as authentic winner of the exercise. The court, in a unanimous decision by a five-man panel of justices led by Mary Odili, held that Lyon's running mate in the election, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremieoyo, presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission, and therefore forced it to disqualify the joint ticket that produced them as initial winners. Reacting to the ruling, former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, commended the judges for the verdict. Senator Douye Diri had cause to visit with me before the elections and received my blessings and counsel. I am fully satisfied that he has what it takes to make Bayelsa the âglory of all landsâ. His intellect, personality and character, are a credit to Bayelsa and the PDP. Senator Ben Murray Bruce from Bayelsa on his Twitter handle @benmurraybruce, said the judgment was victory for truth. I celebrate you, my friend and brother, Senator Douye Diri. Your victory at the Supreme Court is a victory for truth and most especially, a victory for the great people of Bayelsa State. I wish you the best as you continue gallantly, the journey of your predecessor. pic.twitter.com/K7zXfTQjch While reacting to the ruling, Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, said, "I congratulate Senator Douye Diri, our party’s candidate in the Bayelsa governorship elections, who is now the governor-elect following the Supreme Court decision today. I congratulate Senator Douye Diri, our partyâs candidate in the Bayelsa governorship elections, who is now the governor-elect following the Supreme Court decision, today.

I congratulate the @OfficialPDPNig family and most especially, the incoming governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri and his deputy, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo on their victory at the Supreme Court. This is a defining judgement and a triumph for Bayelsa state. pic.twitter.com/FQCIN6quph Apart from prominent personalities, other Nigerians also expressed their thoughts about the ruling. A Twitter user, @Israeloflife, while reacting to the development, said, “The Supreme Court has removed an APC governor and replaced same with a PDP man.There’d be no attacks on the judiciary now. There’d be no one million-man march against the decision. Democracy isn’t in danger now. Surugede is the dance of the spirits.” @Uncle_Ajala in his reaction said, “See how the running mate to Lyon stopped him from becoming governor of Bayelsa State by presenting fake credentials according to Supreme Court. "May we not work with someone that will ruin our hard work and achievement. On his part, @Dinerojay22 said, “Let them scrap INEC since Supreme Court is now deciding who wins elections. "INEC is losing its credibility everyday in the hands of our judiciary.” @Olufemiloye in his reaction stated that, “I was about to say democracy will now be in danger or not depending on which side the politicians and their supporters are. "Bayelsa judgment is as interesting as Imo judgment to me. "And those who condemned the Supreme Court for the Imo will now commend it, and vice versa."
