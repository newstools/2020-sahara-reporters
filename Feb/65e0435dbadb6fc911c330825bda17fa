Diezani Alison-Madueke
AP Photos Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, has called on the United Kingdom authorities to extradite Nigeria’s former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke, over corruption. The former left Nigeria shortly after the expiration of the tenure of ex-President, Goodluck Jonathan, in 2015 and had failed to return to the country. Making the call on Monday during a briefing with journalists in Kaduna, Magu claimed that Alison-Madueke stole not less than $2.5bn during her time as minister. He said, “I was in London this year, we did investigation together with the UK team, and anywhere I go I always call for extradition of corrupt Nigerians to return back the money. “This woman has stolen so much, not less than $2.5bn but unfortunately she has generation of looters who are supporting her. This is not good. “We are in touch with the international community, she is under protective custody, otherwise, we would have arrested her, return her to Nigeria. “We will not allow corruption to work here in Nigeria because it is destructive and disastrous. We blocked several accounts.”
