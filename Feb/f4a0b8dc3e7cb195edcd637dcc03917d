APC vs PDP cartoon Yenagoa, capital of Bayelsa State, is currently witnessing a heavy presence of security personnel following Thursdayâ€™s ruling of the Supreme Court in Abuja, which nullified the election that produced All Progressive Congress candidate, David Lyon, as governor-elect of the state. Lyon and his running mate, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremieoyo, were sacked by the apex court, clearing the way for Diri Douye of the Peoples Democratic Party to emerge as new governor-elect of Bayelsa. In a unanimous judgment delivered by Justice Ejembi Ekwo, the court ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Lyon and hand a fresh one to Duoye after it was discovered that the academic credentials submitted to INEC by Degi-Eremieoyo were forged. Resident of Yenagoa especially PDP supporters have since been jubilating all across the city following the ruling delivered earlier today. Douye is expected to be sworn-in as substantive governor of Bayelsa on Friday.
