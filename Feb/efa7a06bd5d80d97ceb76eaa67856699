A 20-year-old prospective university student has gone missing in Ondo State after visiting Akure, the state capital, to make inquiries on the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination registration. The victim known as Samuel Aboyemi was on his way to his hometown in Igbara-Oke when he suddenly disappeared and his phone line switched off. Mother of the victim, Mrs Aboyemi, who confirmed the news to SaharaReporters, said the case had been reported to the Ondo State Police Command. She said, “He (Samuel) travelled to Akure Monday for the registration of his UTME and called me immediately he was through with it. “He called me around 2:30pm that he had already boarded a bus and that he was on his way home. Shortly afterwards, his telephone line became switched off. “I had to report the matter at the Anti-kidnapping Unit of the police when he didn’t return home.” She disclosed that her son was a holder of National Diploma certificate from a polytechnic but was encouraged to sit for UTME in order to gain admission into a university. A police officer with the Anti-kidnapping Squad of the Ondo State Police Command, who confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters, said they were making efforts to find the victim. He said, “It is true the case was reported to our unit and we have begun an investigation into the incident. In fact, we are trying to track his line to confirm his last location.” Spokesperson for the Ondo State Police Command, Femi Joseph, said he had not been briefed about the incident when contacted by our correspondent.
