 Chairman of Exam Ethics Marshals International, Ike Onyechere, has said 15,550 parents have signed an online petition demanding that the Sex-for-Grade bill be passed into law. Onyechere said the signature, which was garther online, has been sent to the National Assembly. He also said the petitioners were made up of 56 per cent women and 44 per cent men, noting that the petition was pasted on the Internet and more people were “still signing the petition until the bill is passed into law and implemented.” Onyechere said the bill had earlier been frustrated when it was first introduced at the National Assembly in 2016.
