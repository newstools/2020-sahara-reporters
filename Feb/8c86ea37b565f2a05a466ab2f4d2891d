 The Supreme Court in Abuja on Tuesday granted the prayers of Emeka Ihedioha by adjourning ruling on the review of the judgment that removed him as governor of Imo State on January 14, 2020. Ihedioha had through his lawyer, Chief Kanu Agabi (SAN), told the court that processes were still being filed on the case and therefore needed an adjournment to prepare a strong showing. Agabi said, “My lords, processes are still coming in. Up till this morning, we were still receiving processes. We therefore, apply for an adjournment to enable all the processes to come in.” Acceding to the request, the seven-man panel of judges led by Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammad, fixed March 2, 2020 for hearing of the matter. Recall that the Supreme Court had on January 14 ruled that Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress was the authentic winner of the March 9, 2019 Imo State governorship election. The apex court said that after other results not initially acknowledged by the Independent National Electoral Commission was taken into consideration, it emerged that Uzodinma scored the highest number of votes and therefore was the real winner of the exercise. The decision saw to the immediate removal of Ihedioha from office and led to series of protests by members of the Peoples Democratic Party in parts of the country. On February 5, 2020, Ihedioha approached the court to review its judgment because he was certain there were errors in the ruling. However, with Tuesday adjournment, the tension generated by the matter is far from over.
