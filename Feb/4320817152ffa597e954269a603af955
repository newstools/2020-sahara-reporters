Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja, has adjourned the commencement of trial of human rights activists, Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare, until Wednesday. The judge took the step to allow amended charges against the two men to be accommodated in the courtâ€™s proceedings. This came after she ordered the Nigerian Government to pay Sowore and Bakare N200,000 each for the delayed trial following a sloppy showing by the prosecution counsel, A. Aliyu. See Also
