 Deontay Wilder was rushed to a hospital after his defeat to Tyson Fury in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, on Saturday night. Wilder was dominated by Fury as he suffered the first professional defeat of his career, being knocked down twice en route a stoppage defeat in the seventh round, according to Independent UK. It was the first knockdown, which saw Wilder sustain the injury that would eventually be the difference as Fury swung a right hook towards the back of his head, bouncing off the ear and possibly perforating the eardrum. Wilder was then dominated by body and head shots to which he had no real answer until his corner decided the fight could be no more and brought to a close towards the end of the seventh round. Fury was then crowned WBC heavyweight champion before both men spoke graciously in the ring, as Wilder skipped the post-fight press conference and was taken immediately to hospital to be examined for possible ear injuries as well as a general observation.
