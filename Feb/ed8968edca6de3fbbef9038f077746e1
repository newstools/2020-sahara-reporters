  Sukur Kingdom, Africa's first UNESCO cultural site in Adamawa State, may lose some of its natural endowments following a leadership tussle, SaharaReporters has gathered. Signs indicating grave danger surfaced when this year's annual Sukur Cultural Festival, which often attracted domestic and international tourists, was suspended. As gathered, the leadership crisis erupted when a Marghi tribesman was appointed as district head of Sukur following the death of the last Sukur-speaking ruler. Sequel to this development, leaders of Sukur Development Association have vehemently rejected what to them is imposition of a non Sukur indigene as their ruler. They also alleged that there were expansionist moves by Marghi-speaking settlers to influence the Adamawa State Government to rename the district from Sukur to Midlu. This, according to them, was in a bid to erase their famous ancestral Sukur cultural heritage. The area is located in the heart of Madagali Local Government Area frequently attacked by Boko Haram terrorists. There is currently fears across the community of an attack by insurgents any moment from now. A prominent resident of the area, Dr John Njile, while speaking with journalists on Saturday in Yola, the state capital, over the matter, urged Governor Ahmadu Fintiri to intervene to avert a crisis in the community. He said, “The appointment of a non Sukur indigene to the throne of the district head of Sukur and the move to change the name from Sukur to Midlu is an affront on our national identity. “Apart from being an attempt to forcefully change our history that could lead to turmoil and endanger the peaceful coexistence of Sukur and its neighbours; it is also a threat to Sukur world heritage site.”
