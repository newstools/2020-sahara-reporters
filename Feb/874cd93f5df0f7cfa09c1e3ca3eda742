The Concerned Nigeria group, a civil rights movement in the country dedicated to protection of human rights and rule of law, has condemned the invasion of the Abuja office of Amnesty International Nigeria by a group of sponsored protesters. The sponsored protesters earlier in the day barricaded the office of the pro-right group in the country, preventing daily activities from going on. The demonstration marked the fourth time sponsored protesters would be storming Amnesty office to demand their exit from the country. Previous protests had held on March 20, 2017, 23rd of May 2018, 2nd of August 2019  and today, 11th of February 2020. Reacting to the protest, the Concerned Nigerians in a statement by Deji Adeyanju, described the sponsored protest as a show of shame. Adeyanju said, “It has become a reoccurring event that anytime Amnesty International calls for accountability and talks about the gross human right abuses, incessant killings and maiming of citizens in Nigeria, the government through their hired protesters will promptly occupy their office and start making demands for them to quit Nigeria.

The continued harassment of Amnesty International must stop.”
