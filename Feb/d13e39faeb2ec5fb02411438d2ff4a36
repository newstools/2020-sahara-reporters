Gunmen Madam Fadeni, mother of the Chairman of the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company, Mr Sehinde Fadeni, who was abducted in Ondo State by suspected gunmen, has been freed. She was released from captivity on Thursday in Ore under Odigbo Local Council Area of the state after 10 days in captivity. Recall that the woman was kidnapped at her residence in Ode Aye town in Okitipupa on January 28, 2020 and was taken to an unknown destination in a private vehicle. Confirming her release, a source said, "She looked very weak by the time I got the hospital in Ore where she is receiving treatment. "Her abductors were only satisfied with the negotiations of the ransom before they could allow her go after series of plea from the family. "The most annoying aspect of it is that, the kidnappers were pressing the family with all sorts of threats before they finally reached an agreement on the ransom and she was freed.” Spokesperson for the Ondo State Police Command, Femi Joseph, confirmed the release of the woman when contacted by our correspondent, adding that investigation into the case had commenced. He said, "It's true that the woman had been released but that does not stop our own investigation.”
