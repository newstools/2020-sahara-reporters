Getty Images  Barely a month after the Nigerian Government introduced the $110 biometrics and service charge through the Nigeria Immigration Service, the authorities have now exempted the citizens of United States of America from the policy. The government had in January reintroduced the $90 biometrics charge and $20 service charge for all foreigners travelling into Nigeria. This was first introduced in 2018 but after much controversies, it was suspended. A source confided in our correspondent on Tuesday that the US Government threatened to stop issuance of entry visas to Nigerians if the policy was not immediately reversed for its citizens. At the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, it was observed that citizens of the United States were only issued visas on arrival by officials of immigration, while those with prior visas were allowed into the country by the service. The same was the case at the Lagos airport where US citizens were given free passage. The source said, “I can confirm to you that the Nigeria Immigration Service has stopped the collection of biometrics and service charges from citizens of the US. “As I am talking to you now, US citizens are entering the country without collection of the charges.” There is however, concerns that while government may have dropped the policy for US citizens, nationals of other countries were still being charged the fee before allowed into Nigeria.
