Ahead of this year's governorship election in Ondo State, the Peoples Democratic Party in the state has said it would be disastrous for it not to win the exercise fixed for October 10, 2020. Clement Faboyede, Chairman of the party in the state, who stated this on Wednesday in Akure, the capital, said they will work hard to reclaim the state from the All Progressives Congress. He said, "We are not unaware that a strategy of our opponents would be to cause discord and disagreement amongst us as party members. "I do believe that our opponents realise and respect the huge potential in our unity as PDP members than we seem to know or understand ourselves. "I am quite disturbed and concerned that party members are not realizing the magnitude and destiny defining importance of this coming election. "In plain terms, if we dare to lose the next election, it would be catastrophic for us."
