 No less than 11 civilians have been killed after Boko Haram terrorists launched two separate attacks in Niger. An official told the AFP on Saturday that in one attack on Friday, members of the group killed six civilians in Bosso district in the South-East region of Diffa bordering Chad and Nigeria. Four members of the same family were among those killed, said the official. Officials in Bosso district confirmed the attack, but said five people had been killed. In a separate attack in the South-Western region of Tillaberi, which borders Mali, four armed men on two motorbikes opened fire on workers in the village of Molia, killing four people on Thursday, a regional official told AFP. The attacks were just the latest in a surge in violence in the West African country. Niger’s Diffa and Tillaberi regions are vulnerable to increasingly deadly incursions by the jihadists based in Northern Nigeria. According to an official toll, three attacks in December and January all claimed by Islamic State, have killed 174 soldiers. In January, officials in Tillaberi were forced to suspend voter registration in several towns because of the growing violence.
