 The Adamawa State Government has said that no new polio case has been recorded in the state over the last three years. This was disclosed during the flag off of 2020 round of immunisation in Ganye town by Dr Batulu Mohammed, Chairperson of Primary Healthcare Development Agency in the state. Mohammed urged parents to avail their children for the exercise so as to further ensure no case of the condition is recorded. Mohammed said, “The state had maintained a clean sheet of polio case in the past three years.” During the flag off, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri disclosed that 1.2 million children were targeted for this year's house-to-house exercise. Represented by deputy governor of the state, Crowther Seth, Fintiri said his administration was determined to kick out polio from Adamawa and as such the government was ready to collaborate with key stakeholders like WHO and UNICEF to combat the deadly scourge.
