NAN  The proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra has vowed to fight back terrorism attacks in its territory. Media and Publicity Secretary of the group, Emma Powerful, urged members to resist bandits’ attacks in their region. Powerful condemned the January 10 attack on Delta State Police Command personnel, who were on a stop-and-search duty in Asaba, the capital. The incident occurred around 9:00pm at the popular Abraka Market area of Asaba and left about three policemen with varying degrees of injury. Their rifles were reportedly taken away by the bandits. Gunmen had also attacked Avwon, Agadama, Ohoror and other communities in Uwheru Kingdom, Ughelli North Local Government Areas of the state. At least eight persons were killed while several others sustained injuries. IPOB said the killings were “premeditated slaughter of the defenceless.” “IPOB’s message of freedom is the only way out of the present impasse in the fight against terrorism in Nigeria,” he said. The group said it would resist every attempt by herdsmen to unleash terror on “Biafraland”. “Therefore, we are calling on our people to be prepared because we are going to take on terrorists in our land,” he added.
