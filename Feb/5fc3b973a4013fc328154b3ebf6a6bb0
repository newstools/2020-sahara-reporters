IGP Mohammed Adamu  Nigeria’s Inspector-General of Police, Muhammed Adamu, has announced that community policing would be integrated into ‘Operation Amotekun’ recently established by governors of the six South-West states. Adamu made the disclosure in Lagos on Thursday during a meeting with governors of the region. He said, “This is the second meeting we have held with the governors of the South-West region concerning the creation of Operation Amotekun. The just-concluded meeting was to discuss and fine-tune Amotekun. “Amotekun is not a regional security outfit. Every state has one form of security arrangement, whether it is vigilante or neighbourhood watch that is working security agencies in the states to fight crime. Amotekun is not different from these initiatives. “We have agreed that community policing strategy be infused into the Amotekun structure so that policing will be the initiative of the community members.” According to Adamu, the police would be part of the recruitment, training, and deployment of personnel to be assigned for the new security network.
