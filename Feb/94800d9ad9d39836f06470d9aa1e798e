 Women and children numbering over 1000 abandoned their homes in remote communities in Borno State for the streets of Maiduguri, the capital, over fears of more Boko Haram attacks. Chairperson of Borno State Emergency Management Agency, Hajiya Yabawa Kolo, said the women and children are from 300 households in Kayamla, a community under Konduga Local Government Area of the state. The people left their villages to avoid being raided by Boko Haram following repeated attacks on neighbouring villages. The women said their husbands sent them to Maiduguri to seek refuge while they stayed back in Kayamla. Some of the women said they were not allowed into designated camps and had to take refuge on the streets. However, Kolo said camps had been created to accommodate the displaced victims.
