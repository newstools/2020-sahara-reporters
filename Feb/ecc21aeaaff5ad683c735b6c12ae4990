 Protesters under the aegis of All Progressives Congress Youths Stakeholders Forum have embarked on a protest to call for the removal of National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole. The protesters besieged the National Secretariat of the party on Monday in Abuja asking the former labour leader to do the right thing and vacate office. The protesters said his continued stay in office was a curse and would further bring more misfortune for the party, adding that his action had decimated the number of states controlled by APC from 24 to 18. Leader of the group, Genesis Johnson, who addressed journalists, said they were disappointed with the leadership style of Oshiomhole. Johnson said, “Look at what happened in Bayelsa State, it was caused by Oshiomhole and we say enough is enough. We want him to leave that office. He is not the only Nigerian that can manage that office. “Since he came into this office, he has been creating problems for the party. “We are not happy with his conduct and we are asking him to go.”
