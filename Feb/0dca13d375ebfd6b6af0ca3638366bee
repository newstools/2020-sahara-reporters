  After much reporting my SaharaReporters and other news website, the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi, Lagos, has suspended Chima Igwe as its Acting Director-General. The research institute went ahead to announce Dr Agnes Yemisi Asagbra as its new Acting DG. Igwe was suspended after public outcry on the veracity of the doctorate degree he is parading. He claimed to have completed his doctorate from the Universite d’Abomey-Calavi, but the school denied that he completed and earned the PhD. Recently, staff of the research institute embarked on series of protests demanding that Igwe publicly presents his doctorate certificate or step down from his position. The Human and Environmental Development Agenda had sent a petition to the Nigerian Government to sack Igwe over alleged certificate forgery. Asagbra’s profile has already been logged onto the website of FIIRO. See Also
