  Top members of Nigeriaâ€™s main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, on Tuesday, embarked on a peaceful demonstration at the embassy of the European Union and France in Abuja. National Secretary of the party, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri, presented a petition by the PDP officials at both embassies. According to Tsauri, democracy has been derailed in Nigeria and therefore the international community needed to wade in to save the situation. Recall that the PDP leadership had on January 20 embarked on a protest march in Abuja over the Supreme Court judgment that removed Emeka Ihedioha as governor of Imo State. The party equally called on world leaders to intervene to save Nigeria's democracy.
