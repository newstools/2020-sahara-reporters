  The Nigerian Communications Commission and Nigerian Postal Service would now work together to ensure that addresses of SIM card owners are verified. The two made the agreement in Abuja and are working out Memorandum of Understanding to iron out the details. It was also agreed that the commission and the postal service would collaborate on driving the Federal Government’s digital economy agenda. The NCC and NIPOST will also partner on Internet access for people in rural areas and provision of e-governance services in all local government councils in the country. Speaking at the meeting, Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer of NIPOST, Adebayo Adelusi, said the postal service was going through a difficult phase at the moment. Adelusi said NIPOST needed to partner with NCC to leverage available opportunities. He disclosed that issues surrounding the collection of stamp duty, which had become a bone of contention between NIPOST and the Federal Inland Revenue Service, had not been resolved. Adelusi observed that his predecessor fought very hard to ensure that NIPOST retained the right to collect the revenue for the Federal Government. The Postmaster General noted that NIPOST had what was needed to provide banking services for Nigerians. He said, “We want to tap and leverage on our properties across the country to provide services for the people in the rural areas.”
