The Supreme Court on Thursday in Abuja upturned the victory of David Lyon, candidate of the All Progressives Congress, as winner of the November 16, 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State. The apex court went ahead to declare the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party as governor-elect of the keenly contested exercise. Led by Justice Mary Peter-Odili, the five-member panel of the Supreme Court ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to Lyon after the election. Justice Ejembi Ekwo, who read the lead judgment of the court, made the order after disqualifying Lyon’s running mate in the exercise, Degi-Eremienyo, over forged certificates submitted to INEC. The apex court upheld the November 12, 2019 judgment of the Federal High Court in Abuja, which had earlier disqualified Degi-Eremienyo. According to the Supreme Court, Degi-Eremienyo’s disqualification had affected the joint ticket upon which he and Lyon contested the exercise.
