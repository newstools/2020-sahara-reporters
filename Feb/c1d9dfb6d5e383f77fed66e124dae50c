He said, “This is the time to be united against the forces of evil attacking our nation. The church has been under gruesome attack, as we know what has been going on in recent times. “The federal government has to rise up to deal with insecurity in the nation. “With insecurity, the country cannot make any progress, that is why we have to pray more for the Lord to intervene in our nation. “Our leaders should be having sleepless nights when you look at the number of unemployed youths in our nation. “The youth are fed up, we pray they don’t explode and bring down this nation themselves. They finish university and are not guaranteed a job, that’s why we have to deal with insecurity so we can attract foreign investment.”
