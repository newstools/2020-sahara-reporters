Suspected Boko Haram terrorists have attacked farmers at a village under Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State, killing two persons. A nurse at Michika General Hospital told SaharaReporters that a woman was rushed in with bullet wound on Wednesday evening. She said, "A woman was brought in yesterday evening with fractured legs from bullet wounds and we had to refer her case to Mubi General hospital. "Those who brought her told us that her husband and one other lady were killed while working on their farm in Madagali by the terrorists." However, an officer in charge of troops in Madagali, Colonel Abdulsalam, told our correspondent that there was no Boko Haram attack in the area. He said, "There was no attack anywhere in Madagali, because I'm in Madagali and no one has informed us of any attack."
