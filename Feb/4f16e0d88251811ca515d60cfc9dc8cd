  The Ondo State Government on Wednesday approved the draft bill for the establishment of the regional security outfit code-named "Operation Amotekun". Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General in the state, Kola Olawoye, made the disclosure to journalists in Akure. Olawoye said that the bill will be forwarded to the stateâ€™s House of Assembly for scrutiny and ratification. He noted that the bill when passed into law by the assembly, would be named Ondo State Security Network and draw preference from the Amotekun Corps. According to Olawoye, the draft bill which has six parts and 44 sections, is expected to compliment the efforts of the Nigeria Police when finalised into a law. He added that traditional rulers in the state would have key roles to play especially in the operation of the security outfit in order to achieve its aim. Recall that in January the six South-West governors came together to establish the regional security outfit as part of moves to arrest to the rising spate of insecurity across the region.
