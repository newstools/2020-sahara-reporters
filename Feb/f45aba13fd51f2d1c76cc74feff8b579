  A Nigerian, Mr Kenneth Friday, who is based in the United States, has staged a solo protest in front of the White House in Washington DC by calling on President Donald Trump to place a visa ban on all political appointees in Nigeria over financial misconduct especially the Coordinator of the Niger Delta Presidential Amnesty Programme, Prof Charles Dokubo. Kenneth, a beneficiary of the amnesty programme, alleged that Dokubo was being used to siphon funds meant for the programme. He said, “Prof Dokubo boasts of bribing President Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Alhaji Abba Kyari with $2.8m, he also bribed the President’s nephew, Alhaji Mamman Daura, with $1.7m to retain him in office. “Dokubo has stolen over $83m, an equivalent of N30bn, within the past two years and President Buhari has kept him in office to continue diverting public funds which is now being used to sponsor terrorist activities despite the fact that Dokubo’s appointment tenure expired since May 29, 2019. “We want the United States Government, FBI and CIA to know that Nigerian Presidential officials are using Prof Dokubo to sponsor terrorist activities. #PressPlay: Nigerian Takes Protest To White House Over Niger Delta Amnesty Programme @NigeriaGov @NGRPresident @MBuhari pic.twitter.com/UtsEJW1UZv  “They have intentionally kept him in office despite the fact that appointment expired since May 2019 because they are using him to divert millions dollars to sponsor persons in Northern Nigeria that have contacts with terrorist groups.” When contacted by SaharaReporters, Murphy Ganagana, spokesperson for the Amnesty Office, dismissed the allegations, saying it was a smear campaign against Prof Dokubo. He said, “That person is fake and as such we don’t have a beneficiary by that name in the United States. “The only beneficiary is a female and she is studying medicine. That man is being sponsored and those allegations don’t make any sense.”
