 Former Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, has denied allegations made by ex-Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Farida Waziri, that she was sacked because she probed some oil racketeers. Waziri had claimed in her book that she was sacked because she made some arrest that could have foiled some illegal oil businessmen but she was ordered to release the suspects and was subsequently sacked. Reacting to the allegation, Jonathan, speaking through his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, said Waziri was in fact sacked over national interest. He explained that her removal had a lot to do with reasons relating to Nigeria’s interest and global standing which details Jonathan said he was obliged to keep as a state secret. Ibe said, “It must be pointed out that former President Jonathan had no personal issues with Mrs Waziri. "The former President had to eventually let her go in the national interest. "Her removal, therefore, has a lot to do with reasons relating to Nigeria’s interest and global standing which details Dr Goodluck Jonathan is obliged to keep as state secret in our common national interest. "It is very important to note that when dealing with the interest of the nation and the performance of the functions of a public office, a determined leader cannot prioritise the interest of an individual.”
