Dr Omonijo Akinyemi Gabriel, the embattled Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities at the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, has dragged the authorities of the university before the National Industrial Court sitting in Akure, Ondo State, over his indefinite suspension. Omonijo, who is a senior lecturer in the Department of Water Resources and Agrometeorology at the university said that his indefinite suspension without pay by was illegal, unconstitutional and a violation of the provisions of the Trade Union Act. He explained in a suit with case registration number NICN/AK/21/2019 filed before the court by his lawyer; Funmi Falana of Falana & Falana’s Chambers, that his suspension from the school did not follow due process as stipulated in the act establishing the institution. According to the writ of summon sighted by SaharaReporters and deposed before the court, the plaintiff is asking the court to declare his suspension without pay by the institution as null and void. He also prayed the court to direct the university authorities to reinstate him to his status as senior lecturer and pay his “salaries, allowances and entitlements from February 2019 till the judgment is given.” As part of defence before the court, Omonijo added that the investigative panel that recommended his suspension to the university was biased based on its prejudiced composition, while describing the members as hostile individuals. The plaintiff sought an order from the court restraining the university from further interfering with his rights, privileges, and performance of duties as Chairman of ASUU. At the beginning of the hearing, Funmi Falana stood for the claimant, while Barrister Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), represented FUOYE.The case has been adjourned until March 18, 2020 at the Industrial Court in Akure.
