Adebayo Raphael



A civil society organisation under the umbrella of Center for Advancement of Civil Liberties and Development has kicked off an awareness and sensitization programme tagged "Electoral Reform Advocacy". The programme is aimed at galvanising the public towards electoral reform by creating awareness on the current deficit in the electoral process.Addressing journalists on Friday in Abuja, Co-convener of the group, Raphael Adebayo, said the advocacy would facilitate the needed reform required in our electoral system.The programme, which was also supported by the Open Society Initiative for West Africa, would ensure the immediate passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2018 by the National Assembly. Adebayo expressed concern on the repeated failure to organise elections according to global standard, which had damaged the Nigeria's reputation in the comity of nations. Adebayo said, "We believe that the National Assembly has a responsibility to actively aggregate the general view of all stakeholders in Nigeria’s democratic process. "The group includes civil society organisations, political parties, international partners and especially the electorate to legislate an enduring electoral reform act that will reinforce the trust of the electorates and other stakeholders in the credibility of Nigeria’s electoral process."
