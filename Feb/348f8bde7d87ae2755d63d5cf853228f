  The All Progressives Congress has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to de-register more political parties to sanitise Nigeria’s electoral system. Chairman of Ebonyi Chapter of APC, Mr Nwachukwu Eze, made the call in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria on Monday in Abakaliki. Eze said the de-registration process should continue until the country had a maximum of six political parties to ensure that the electoral space was not ‘unnecessarily congested’. He said, “We applaud INEC for doing the needful as such de-registration had been overdue. “We had a situation where few individuals or family members put-up papers and register with INEC but do not exist in states or anywhere in the country. “They do not have offices, membership bases, structures and one person in most cases, is the chairman, secretary and other members of the executive. “INEC has presently decided to sanitise the system and this can be likened to the deleting of unwanted files in a computer for it to have enough storage space. “This decision will make logos of political parties appear bold on ballot papers and make voters have enough space to thumb-print. “When we have over 90 political parties on a ballot paper, illiterate voters would be confused on how to thumb-print. “There is no case of victimisation in the decision as the affected parties know they are not in existence.”
