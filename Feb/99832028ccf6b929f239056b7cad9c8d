He explained that the appointment comprises two personal assistants from each ward and 38 special assistants. “While the PAs are to serve as links between the lawmaker and grassroots, the SAs would represent various special interests including women, youths, students, physically challenged and the aged through the constituency office in Bambam,” the statement read.
