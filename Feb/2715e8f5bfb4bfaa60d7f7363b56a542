The Italian detected to have contracted the deadly Coronavirus in Nigeria was on Saturday moved to an upgraded isolation and treatment facility by the Lagos State Government. This came after the Italian complained about the poor state of the facility he was earlier placed in, which made him attempt to abscond from the centre. Announcing the latest development, Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof Akin Abayomi, said the Italian was currently receiving treatment at the Infectious Disease facility at the Mainland Hospital in the Yaba area of the city. He said, “We were renovating part of the facilities, so we kept him in a single isolation room for his privacy but we’ve subsequently moved him to one of our completed wards recently renovated with the full complement of facilities.
