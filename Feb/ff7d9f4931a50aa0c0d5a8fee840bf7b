The gunmen were said to have stormed Bang, a coastal community in Numan Local Government Area and killed the two men, injuring another septuagenarian. The deceased village head, Alpha William, and one of his subjects were killed while fleeing, according a local source. The attackers were said to have raided the community at about 7:00pm on Wednesday, torched buildingsÂ  and carted away valuables.
