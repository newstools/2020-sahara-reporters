NSA Monguno  Nigeria's National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd), has shunned a 'special meeting' conveyed by President Muhammadu Buhari and service chiefs in the country on Monday. Monguno in a memo obtained by SaharaReporters had accused the President's Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, of making security decisions without Buhari's consent or approval. In the scathing document addressed to Buhari and other service chiefs, Monguno explained that Kyari's meddlesomeness was worsening the security situation in the country.
