  The African Action Congress has said that it remains unmoved despite the vilification and persecution of its leader, Omoyele Sowore, by the Nigerian Government. National Deputy Chairman of the party, South-South, Comrade Ken Henshaw, disclosed this on Monday in Abuja during the National Executive Committee meeting of the party. He said the attack on its leader was as a result of the potential, vigour and prospects of the party to wrestle power from the ruling All Progressives Congress. Henshaw said, “People have been saying revolution but why our own is important is because they know we are coming with force and that is why they have to take us out quickly. “They did not imagine the resilience of the membership of AAC. They thought that as soon as they took our leader out, it will be all over for us. They never imagined that the movement could become stronger.” Henshaw encouraged members not to be deflated by the harassment of the leadership of the party in some states, adding that it is a phase that would soon pass away. He said, “I believe very strongly that in 2023 the contest will no longer be between the PDP, APC or any alliance for that manner. The party to beat will be AAC at the rate we are going.” The meeting had in attendance the National Executive members and regional and state chairmen.
