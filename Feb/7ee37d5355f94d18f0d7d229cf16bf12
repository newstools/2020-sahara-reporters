  Boko Haram terrorists have killed at least 30 people and abducted many women and children in a raid on Auno Road in Borno State. In December 2019, SaharaReporters after seeing intelligence reports, authoritatively reported that insurgents were planning major abductions in Benishiek, Ngala, Auno, Mainok, Dikwa-monguno and Biu roads. The fresh attacks followed a directive from #ISIS caliph al-Hashimi, which instructed the intensification of attacks especially on Christians in the region. The terrorists are currently occupying farms and villages along the Biu highway in preparation for further attacks, the AFP said.

1 Month Ago The jihadists stormed in on trucks mounted with heavy weapons, killing, burning and looting before kidnapping women and children, state government spokesman, Ahmad Abdurrahman Bundi, said. They aimed at travellers, who had stopped for the night and torched vehicles. He said, “The attackers killed not less than 30 people who are mostly motorists and destroyed 18 vehicles.” The attack, some 25 kilometres west of Maiduguri, occurred in an area where fighters from the Islamic State West Africa Province have been active, mounting roadblocks to target security forces and civilians. Last month four Nigerian soldiers were killed and seven injured when the jihadists attacked troops positioned in Auno.
