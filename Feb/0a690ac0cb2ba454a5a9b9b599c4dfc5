Iran on Wednesday confirmed that two persons in the country had tested positive to the Covid 19 virus, which emerged from Wuhan, China. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to about 75,209, more than 74,000 of them coming from China. AFP quoted Kianoush Jahanpour, spokesperson for the country’s health ministry, as saying that the cases were detected in the city of Qom, South of the Iranian capital. “In the past two days, some suspect cases of the new Coronavirus were observed in Qom city,” he said, quoted by state news agency IRNA. “Teams were dispatched after receiving the reports, and based on the existing protocols the suspect cases were isolated and tested,” added Jahanpour. “Out of the samples sent, a laboratory tested two of them as positive for Coronavirus just minutes ago and some of the other samples were type B influenza,” he informed. Jahanpour said additional tests were being done on the two cases and final results would be announced “as soon as possible.” An African country – Egypt, recorded its first case of the virus earlier in the week. The patient is said not to be an Egyptian national however. At least the virus has killed 2012 persons from affected countries including China where it first broke out.
