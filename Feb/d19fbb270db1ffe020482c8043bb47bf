 The Anti-Corruption and Integrity Forum has warned the Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission, Joi Nunieh, to ensure every funds put into projects in the commission was accounted for. The ACIF Chairman, Prince Kpokpogri, gave the warning while addressing newsmen in Abuja on Saturday. He said, “Unions of Community Development Committees in the Niger Delta should rise to focus and monitor their projects. “Nobody should be distracted by politicians and looters whose children are schooling and luxuriating overseas at the expense of our commonwealth. Every kobo must be accounted for. No contractor should ask for one kobo payment if they don’t complete their projects. We must protect our region. “The NDDC has become a conduit pipe for contractors and cabals. The North is fast developing owing to their dedication to the policy thrust of their development commission. Stakeholders in the Niger Delta region must stand to emulate that. We must frown at duplication of projects. “Governors in the South-South must stand against the pillage of their resources by corrupt elements. All Niger Deltans must rise to protect their development. “We will not, as an anti-corruption forum, watch, but will employ every available avenue to prosecute contractors and Niger Delta stakeholders found wanting in this anomaly.” The commission has been under public scrutiny since President Muhammadu Buhari ordered a forensic audit of the commission since inception. Quantum amounts of malfeasance and financial misappropriation have been reported as well. Investigative reports have also shown how projects are abandoned, undone or shoddily done.
