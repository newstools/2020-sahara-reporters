The Nigerian Senate on Thursday called on authorities of the Nigerian Army to immediately establish a camp in Auno, the community in Borno State where at least 30 persons were killed by Boko Haram terrorists last Sunday. Members of the upper legislative chamber also called on the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management to urgently supply relief items to affected residents as well as reconstruct the town. President Muhammadu Buhari had on Wednesday visited Maiduguri on arrival from Ethiopia where he had attended the African Union summit to sympathize with people of Borno over the rising spate of killings in the state by terrorists. However, angry residents of the city booed Buhari over his administration's failure to protect their lives.
