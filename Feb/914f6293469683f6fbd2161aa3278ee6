  Five suspects of the December 28, 2019 bank robbery in Mpape, Abuja, were on Friday arraigned at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory in Wuse Zone 2, Abuja, by the police. Ehizo Larry and other defendants including Princewill Obinna, Elijah David, Timothy Joe, and Ernest Ewin, pleaded not guilty to the five counts bordering on armed robbery, attempted armed robbery and illegal possession of firearms. Prosecuting counsel, James Idachaba, called on the court to remand them in prison custody and requested that his team be given one week to present its case. According to him, the prosecution had listed seven witnesses and would tender vital exhibits. He said, “Our case is very easy because the defendants were caught in the act.” Justice Ajoke Adepoju thereafter ordered the remand of the suspects and fixed March 13 for the continuation of hearing.
