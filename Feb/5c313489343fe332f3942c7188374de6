 Mohammed Adoke (SAN), a former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, has expressed his preference to be remanded at the Kuje Correctional Centre than the detention facility of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The decision was made known by his lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), on Monday shortly after the former AGF was arraigned on fresh money laundering charges at the Federal High Court in Abuja. Adoke was arraigned alongside Aliyu Abubakar, who was accused of paying dollar equivalent of N300m into Adoke’s account in September 2013 in violation of the Money Laundering Act. Ozekhome was arguing his client’s bail application when he noted that his client was produced in court by the EFCC from the Federal Medical Centre near Jabi, Abuja, where he had been admitted for treatment. Ozekhome urged the court to grant bail to the former AGF in liberal and affordable terms and conditions, adding that his client would prefer to be remanded in the Kuje Correctional Centre instead of the custody of the EFCC
