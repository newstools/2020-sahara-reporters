  Legal practitioner, Olumide Fusika, standing in for Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, has told Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court that his clients, Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare (Mandate), would not take plea on the new charge filed against them by the Nigerian Government. He said until the prosecution served them with necessary documents on the new and previous charge, they would not take plea. Prosecution counsel, A.A Aliyu, had told the court that they had amended the charge file against the activists and needed the defendants to take their plea. In her ruling, Justice Ojukwu asked the prosecution counsel to avail the defendants the required documents. Recall that Sowore and Bakare are standing trial on seven counts bordering on treasonable felony and cyberstalking President Muhammadu Buhari. The defendants were arrested in August 2019 for calling on Nigerians to demand a better country from the administration of President Buhari. They were released on bail after months of unlawful detention at the headquarters of the Department of State Services in Abuja.
