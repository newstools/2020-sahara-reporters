  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Wednesday arraigned four men for allegedly “tampering with critical mobile telecommunications network system.” The defendants – Richard Edemdem, Samuel Okpapi, Nelson Ojovbo and Bamigbade Olushola – were arraigned before the Federal High Court in Lagos. The EFCC also accused them of taking possession of N36.8m “which you reasonably ought to have known that such funds form part of proceeds of an unlawful act to wit: stealing.” The prosecution told Justice Mohammed Liman that the defendants conspired with a firm, ISD Technology Limited; and one Solo said to be at large, to commit the offences sometime in 2017 in Lagos. The prosecution said they acted contrary to Sections 27(1Hb) and 10 of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention etc) Act, 2015 and were liable to be punished under the same section of the Act. When the three counts were read to them however, the defendants pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting counsel for the EFCC, Anselem Ozioko, prayed the court to fix a date for trial and to remand the defendants in the prison custody. Defence counsel, Olumide Esan, prayed for a short adjournment to enable him file and serve application for his clients’ bail on the prosecution. Justice Liman adjourned the matter until February 19.
