"The bike must strictly be used for courier purposes, no carrying of passengers." Odumosu added that power bikes are also not affected by the restrictions as he warned officers on enforcement to strictly abide by the rules of engagement as contained in the extant laws. The CP also urged its officers to refrain from harassing members of the public during the enforcement of the exercise. He added, "The exercise must be free of harassment and extortion.
