The Islamic Movement in Nigeria has called on the Nigeria Police Force to fish out the officer, who killed journalist, Alex Ogbu, for prosecution. The group made the call on Monday in Abuja in a statement by the Secretary of its Academic Forum, Abdullahi Musa. SaharaReporters had reported that the autopsy result showed that the victim was killed by police bullet contrary to claims that he was an accident victim. Ogbu was killed on January 21 while covering a peaceful protest by members of IMN calling for the release of their leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky. The group called on the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, to surrender the police officer, who shot Ogbu for prosecution. The statement reads, "Since it has become clear that the police killed Mr Ogbu, the trigger-happy officer who fired the bullet that killed him should be fished out immediately and made to face the wrath of what he had committed.” The sect also submitted a copy of the petition to the National Human Rights Commission and demanded for justice for the slain journalist.
