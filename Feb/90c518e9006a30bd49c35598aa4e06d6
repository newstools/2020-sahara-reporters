 The Physically Challenged Empowerment Initiative, the Nigerian Slum/Informal Settlement Federation, and Justice & Empowerment Initiatives – Nigeria took to the streets of Lagos to express their discontentment at the ban of motorcycle and tricycle by the state government. The groups lamented that the ban strongly affected not ordinary people but also persons living with disability and urban poor residents whose livelihoods and transportation systems have been decimated by ban. They posited that the ban has also left ordinary Lagos residents stranded at bus stops across the state and decimated the livelihoods and investments of those involved in lawful and useful transportation businesses. The groups also lamented that the task force set up by the government misused their powers by entering into parks and individual houses to seize motorcycles and tricycles not used. “Some of the worst impacts of this policy have been on persons living with disabilities across Lagos State, many of whom have over recent years been supported by PCEI to leave street begging for more dignified and lawful work of driving kekes. “The ban has witnessed several of their kekes seized on 1 February, 2020 from within a taxi park where they were parked respecting the ban. "Up until now, their petition to the Lagos State Task Force and Commissioner of Police have received no response. “Beyond these violations of our members’ rights to livelihood and property, the chaos in the inadequate transportation system has left ordinary citizens stranded at bus stops across the state.”
