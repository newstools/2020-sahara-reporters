  Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, has vowed to recover over N90bn allegedly stolen by the administration of immediate past governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari, through inflated contracts. Matawalle said this following the presentation of the interim report on projects verification in the state. Chairman of the verification committee, Ahmed Zabarma, had earlier disclosed that 6,180 contracts were awarded when Yari was governor of the state. He said that many of the projects were poorly done and others abandoned. Reacting to the revelation, the governor said he will implement the report of the committee and prosecute anyone, who had embezzled the stateâ€™s resources.
