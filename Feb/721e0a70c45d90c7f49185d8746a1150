President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, has told the United States and China that the African continent was not for taking. He said this while raising concerns about the rivalry for global power between the US and China. Kenyatta stated the two countries were exacerbating divisions in African countries and putting the nations in a position to take sides. He said, “Western countries and their counterparts in Asia and the Middle East are returned to competition over Africa, in some cases weaponising divisions, pursuing proxy actions and behaving like Africa is for the taking. Well, I want to tell you it is not. “We don’t want to be forced to choose. We want to work with everybody, and we believe that there is an opportunity for everybody. “There are those areas indeed where America stands out and has much better strengths in certain fields. On the other hand, you have the Chinese who build hospitals in seven days.”
