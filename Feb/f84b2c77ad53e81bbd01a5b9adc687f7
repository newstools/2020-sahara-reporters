Elias Ozikpu The Nigerian Copyright Commission has invited an activist and author, Elias Ozikpu, over a petition written by his lawyer following an alleged infringement on the copyright to his play entitled, “Heroes of the Night”. Rockson Igelige, counsel to Ozikpu, via a petition dated February 9, 2020 and addressed to the Director-General of the NCC, accused Melrose Books and Publishing Ltd, Macmillan Nigeria Publishers Ltd and Universal Basic Education Commission, of publishing and reprinting his client’s literary work since 2012 and distributing same to schools throughout Nigeria without the prior knowledge and consent of his client. The author, through his lawyer, asked the commission to invoke its investigative and prosecutorial powers under the Nigerian Copyright Act to protect his copyright and ensure violators are duly sanctioned.
