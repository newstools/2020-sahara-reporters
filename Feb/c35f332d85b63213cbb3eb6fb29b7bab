Led in witness by the prosecution, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), Adun, a former operative of the EFCC, now a banker with United Bank for Africa, PLC, told the court that sometime in November 2004, the Commission received a petition from the chambers of Joshua Mba and Co. alleging that a cheque of $2.5bn was deposited on behalf of Petro Union Oil and Gas Limited with Union Bank, and that the bank failed to pay the recipient of the said money. “We invited Isaac Okpala to adopt the petition and he also volunteered statements. We thereafter wrote a letter of invitation to Union Bank, and they sent two representatives. “During investigation, we did not see any proof that will make us continue with the investigation, so we wrote to the complainant that there was no evidence. The complainant however wrote back to us asking us to write Union Bank requesting for the cheque deposited with them, which we did. “I received the cheque Union Bank brought to the Commission, and I signed for it. I also registered it with the exhibit keeper. "Isaac Okpala later wrote to the EFCC, requesting that the cheque be released to him, I processed the bond to release, which he signed and was released to him,” Adun said. The petition, correspondences to Union Bank and the complainant were admitted in evidence and marked as exhibits. Justice Liman had earlier in the proceedings, granted all the defendants bail in the sum of N22m each, and two sureties in like sum. The sureties must be owners of landed properties within the jurisdiction of the court which will be verified by the Lands registry. The address of the defendants will also be verified by the court registrar. The matter was adjourned till March 4, 5, 6, 2020 while the defendants were remanded in prison custody pending the fulfilment of their bail conditions.
