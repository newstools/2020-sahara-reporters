  The Lagos State Police Command has confiscated not less than 86 motorcycles following the clampdown at Iyana Ipaja area of the state. There were media reports that policemen went into peoples’ residents in the area to take possession of the bikes. This led to a clash between the officers and Okada riders on Wednesday. Spokesperson for the command, Bala Elkana, has now disclosed that 34 people were arrested for allegedly attacking police officers. He said, “The Lagos State Task Force on Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences with some police officers carried out enforcement on restrictions of motorcycles and tricycles at Aboru area. “The riders of the impounded motorcycles and thugs in large number advanced and attacked police officers on duty at Iyana Ipaja roundabout, Alaguntan junction and Aboru junction. “One Insp. Salifu Umar was injured by the hoodlums and was rushed to hospital where he is responding to treatment.” Elkana said that one Lagos State Transport Management Agency vehicle and two Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps patrol bicycles were burnt by the hoodlums.
