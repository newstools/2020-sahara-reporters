Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, has said that electricity remains a luxury for members of the elite like him. Kyari made the comments on Tuesday at the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit in Abuja. He said, “For this country and very many of us in sub-Saharan Africa, what we worry about today is actually the meals of today. “There are many who can’t afford a meal a day. And of course, electricity is largely a luxury; it’s only for the elite.” He said there was a need to resolve the issue of electricity supply in the country amidst the global energy transition from the use of fossil fuel to renewable energy.
