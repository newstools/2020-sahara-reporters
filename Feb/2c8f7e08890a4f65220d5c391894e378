 Shuaibu Ibrahim, National Youth Service Corps Director-General has asked  state  coordinators to take care of all corps members during the 2020 Batch A orientation course.He made the call during a pre-orientation meeting with  area coordinators, state coordinators, camp directors, camp commandants and security  officials  at the NYSC headquarters.He said, “The safety  of life  and property of corps members is paramount to us. The management places a high premium on the health and welfare of corps members. Therefore, state coordinators should sensitise all camp officials to deal with corps members with empathy.“The quality and quantity of food served in all camps must be of acceptable standards while the menu timetable must be strictly adhered to.“Sick corps members must be promptly taken to the camp clinic and anyone not showing signs of recovery must be referred to standard hospitals.“We don’t want any death of corps members. We have administrative procedures, and the essence of this warning is that every  one of us should take our jobs very seriously.”
