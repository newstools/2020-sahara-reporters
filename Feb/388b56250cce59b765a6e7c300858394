  The Mammy Market at Mogadishu Cantonment, Abuja-Keffi Expressway in Abuja has been consumed by fire. The fire, which started early morning on Thursday, has reportedly destroyed properties. This was also confirmed by the Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, Army Headquarters Garrison, Omale Ochagwuba, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria. Ochagwuba said, “The concerted efforts of the emergency responders and the barracks community in bringing the fire under control quickly was quite commendable. “Other emergency service like the Federal Road Safety Corps also responded and assisted in controlling traffic at the cantonment bus stop. “The Commander, Army Headquarters Garrison, Maj Gen. J.G Myam, who was physically on ground, directed soldiers to isolate the section of the fire from spreading to other parts of the market. This saved the market from further destruction.”
