 President Muhammadu Buhari has described the recent attack by Boko Haram terrorists on civilians as cowardly. Speaking through his media aide, Garba Shehu, the President said, â€œThe commitment of this administration to protect the lives of Nigerians will not be derailed by the cowardly and indiscriminate violence against innocent people by Boko Haram terrorists. "As our armed forces continue to receive more hardware and intelligence to counter our current security challenges, the remnants of Boko Haram will ultimately be crushed. "The peculiar challenges of asymmetric warfare notwithstanding, our armed forces are ever determined to defeat these enemies of humanity."
