Members of the Boko Haram terrorist group are attacking Korongilum, a community in Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State. The insurgents burnt houses as residents scamper for safety, according to residents, who confirmed the attack. The insurgents came into the community and shot sporadically into the air, TheCable reports. “People were just returning to their houses from the farm when the insurgents came in. “They came in through Forfor, and our people are running for safety as we speak,” a resident, who escaped the invasion told TheCable. A military source said troops from the Nigerian Army’s 28 task force brigade and 117 battalion, are already on their way to Korongilum to stop the attack and rescue the people.
