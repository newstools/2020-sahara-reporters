Boko Haram Terrorists In a new video released, Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, could be seen threatening to attack President Muhammadu Buhari if he visits Maiduguri, Borno State, again. Buhari had visited the troubled city on Wednesday to sympathise with the state over the killing of at least 30 persons on Sunday by terrorists in the town of Auno. But shortly after his visit to the state, Boko Haram insurgents struck again, killing several persons in the process. Shekau, in the latest video where he also listed conditions for the release of the remaining Chibok school girls, warned that Buhari would be attacked if he visited Maiduguri again. He said, “Buhari came to Maiduguri pretending to be a good man but he is not. He shouldn’t try to return to Maiduguri again. “Buhari, fear your Creator. God said you don’t have up to a spider’s web. But you think you are a major general. l swear, you are nothing. Buhari, I am talking to you, you’ll know no peace. Don’t come back to Maiduguri. “Just go and sit down and think over my comments. And if u think I am the one disrupting your affairs, honestly I am not. You have deceived the people by telling them you are a just leader; carry on!” Speaking on Chibok girls, Shekau said, “Those shouting Bring Back Our Girls, Bring Back Our Girls, the only way to have those girls back is for our men in prison to be released.”
