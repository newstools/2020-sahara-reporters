Tope Akinyode We commend the leadership and members of Redeemed Christian Church of God for exercising their constitutional rights as enshrined under Sections 38, 39, 40 and 41 of the 1999 constitution by taking to the street to protest against rising insecurity and wobbling economy in Nigeria. It is unfortunate that the backward President Muhammadu Buhari regime considers every criticism unpatriotic. The biggest disservice of the regime is its clamp down on human rights, free speech and press freedom. It is worthy of note that by virtue of S 33 of the 1999 constitution, every Nigerian has right to life and that right cannot be illegally taken away. It is for this purpose that Section 14 (2) of the constitution provides that 'the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government'. Where government is failing in its primary responsibilities as prevalent today, patriotic citizens of goodwill must protest and register their displeasure against such anomaly. We wish to remind President Buhari that if he find it hard to perform his constitutional duty of protecting the lives and properties of citizens, it is very lawful for him to resign as provided by S 306 (1) and (3) of the constitution. Otherwise, the National Assembly should take the bull by the horn and commence impeachment proceedings against him in accordance with S 143 of the constitution. It is our considered view that there is no more time for Nigerians to sit on the fence or fold their arms over the incompetence of this administration. We hereby call on all Nigerians to raise their voices and demand for the resignation of the president. Tope Akinyode is a human rights lawyer and National President of Revolutionary Lawyer's Forum
