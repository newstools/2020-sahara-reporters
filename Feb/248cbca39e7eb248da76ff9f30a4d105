The trial of former Nigerian lawmaker, Shehu Sani, which commenced on Tuesday at the Federal High Court in Abuja has been adjourned until Wednesday because witnesses presented by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said Sani’s Name was not on the transaction record of Guaranty Trust Bank. After cross-examining the witnesses, Justice Ekwo offered Sani’s lawyers to do same. When they asked each of the witnesses if Sani was the name they saw on the transactions presented before the judge, they declined, saying they didn’t know him. The names were those of persons not identical or identified in court.
