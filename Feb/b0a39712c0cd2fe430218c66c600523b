Spokesperson for the police in the state, Sunday Abutu, also confirmed the arrests on Wednesday. Abutu said the suspects allegedly had sexual intercourse with the victims.

He said, “The suspects, one from Osi Grammar School and two from All Soul’s Grammar School, are in our custody and are giving us useful information. “We have invited the victims and they are giving useful information to us, as well. “But as of now, the victim from Osi Grammar School declined the allegation while being interrogated. But we are not resting, we will get to the root of the matter.” Abutu said the victims from All Soul’s have been invited by the police for interrogation, saying they were yet to give information concerning the incident.
