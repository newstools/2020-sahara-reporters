  The United States Government has pledged  $40m in humanitarian assistance to Nigeria. This was disclosed by the United States Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, during the Binational Commission in Washington DC. He also said the United States would review its immigration restrictions on Nigeria once the government improves its information sharing. He said, “The foreign minister and I discussed how we can tighten our trade ties even further, including in infrastructure investment.  Embracing free-market policies that attract capital – private capital, ensuring consistent enforcement of the law, and doubling down on anti-corruption efforts is the surest way to grow prosperity in Nigeria and all across the region. "I strongly encouraged the Nigerian Government to do more to protect its civilians, including religious communities and the humanitarian organisations seeking to assist them. “To aid in this effort, I’m pleased to announce today an additional $40m in humanitarian assistance to Nigeria, adding to the nearly $350m that we provided last year.”
