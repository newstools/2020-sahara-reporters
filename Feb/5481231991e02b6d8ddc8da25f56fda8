 Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, has blamed the Boko Haram insurgency on the conflict in Libya. He made the comments on Monday while reacting to calls for the removal of service chiefs on NTA’s ‘Good Morning Nigeria’ programme. He said, “Our Armed Forces are doing an enormously good job, they are not sitting on their laurels but the challenges have mounted because of factors extraneous to the region and Nigerians should have an appreciation and be sympathetic and see that all of the things about the collapse of Libya is no fairy tale. “Europeans for their competing interests in Libya were dropping weapons into villages in Libya. A lot of these elements have found their way into ungoverned spaces in the Sahel. Could it be better with the sacking of the service chiefs? My sense is that the President as the Commander-In-Chief is not a novice in the first instance. “He was a military commander, a military head of state and the latitude of opinions intellectual, security, military available to him is not available to most of the critics. “So, it is wrong of them to interlope in a way and begin to speak on matters of which they do not have the competence to pass judgement. I hope I don’t seem arrogant but I am stating facts as they are.”
