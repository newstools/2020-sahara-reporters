Kufo added that Nigerians are looking forward to having a country where citizens can compete at the global stage. He said, “While we consistently push towards a restructured Nigeria, we need to let the government and relevant stakeholders understand that this is the era of ideas, innovations, creativity and digital communications, therefore, there’s need to fund research and innovations in this country if not, danger looms. “We are putting this event together to free up the creative energies of the people of Nigeria especially the younger generation and domesticate responsibility and accountability. "We want a Nigeria where people, through innovations, can creatively compete with global economies against the current trend of consuming without building.” The statement further adds that all vice-chancellors and rectors of government-owned universities and polytechnics in Lagos, Ogun and Oyo states including Babcock University have been specially invited as special guests to the event.
