Callistus Ewelike/NAN  The German Government has announced a new immigration policy to address regular and irregular migration from Nigeria. Minister of State of German Federal Chancellery, Annette Widmann-Mauz, said this in Abuja on Wednesday. Widmann-Mauz speaking through an interpreter, said, “We have to inform people before they leave their country of origin, in this case, Nigeria; to inform them about the legal regular pact of migration, especially over our Skills Migration Act. “We want to make very clear conditions set by the new law and we will like to support them in fulfilling these criteria. “We will like to give advice and inform, but more than that, we will also like to offer language courses and training. “Therefore, we have centres of information and advice, which will enhance the qualification, especially for the labour market. “We will not only like to give information about the criteria for legal migration but at the same time make clear if they are some wrong expectations about migration to Germany.” She said that explanations would be made to clarify issues on what illegal migration results to, saying their target was to support people not to go the dangerous way.
