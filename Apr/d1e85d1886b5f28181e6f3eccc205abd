 As part of efforts at curtailing the spread of Coronavirus in the country, the World Health Organisation and United Nation's Children Fund have taken to rural areas in Adamawa State to educate the people about the pandemic and how to avoid contracting it. The campaign started in Hong Local Government Area of the state with critical stakeholders in attendance. WHO and UNICEF emphasised the need for social distancing and frequent hygiene practices among rural dwellers as a way of preventing the spread of the virus. Officials of the Ministry of Health and staff of the National Orientation Agency provided explanations on the need to adhere to the lockdown policy. Demonstrations about stopping the spread of the pandemic were made, as participants were broken into groups of 50 persons each for easy understanding of the sensitisation. Sapphire Health and Education Foundation, which sponsored the campaign, also distributed free hand sanitisers, nose and mouth masks.
