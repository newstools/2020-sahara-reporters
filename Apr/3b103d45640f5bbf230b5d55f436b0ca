The Coalition for Revolution has urged Nigerians to join the #PansPotsProtests from Saturday April 25 to May 2 against the lockdown put in place in the country by government. President Muhammadu Buhari had locked down the Federal Capital Territory, Lagos and Ogun on March 30. CORE in a statement by its Co-convener, Baba Aye, urged Nigerians to stay in front of their houses; balconies and verandas, observing the social distancing and hitting their empty pots and pans. The statement reads, “Whereas Nigerians cannot continue to suffer double from Coronavirus and hunger virus. “The #RevolutionNow movement supports the several revolts in Warri; Sapele; Gwagwalada; Onitsha; Lagos; and Abeokuta.
