 The Chadian Army has killed dozens of Boko Haram terrorists in retaliation for the terror group’s ambush of its soldiers. The ambush killed at least 90 soldiers last week. Earlier this week, Chadian President, Idriss Deby, directed commanders of a multi-national joint task force to embark on operations against the Islamic sect. In a video showing moments after the successful operation, Chadian troops can be seen chanting victory songs while showcasing bodies of Boko Haram terrorists.

He said, “Do not think because you have fought several secular wars in several fronts you can fight those of us that chose to fight for the Jihad.” The Nigerian Army suffered a similar ambush on its troops in Borno State, the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurgency, losing more than 70 soldiers.
