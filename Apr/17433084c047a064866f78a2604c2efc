 The Magistrates Court sitting in Akure, Ondo State, has remanded four suspects connected to the murder of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Afenifere leader, Pa Rueben Fasoranti, at the Owo facility of the Nigerian Correctional Service. The suspects including Lawal Mazaje, Adamu Adamu, Mohammed Shehu Usman and Auwal Abubakar were members of an eight-man gang that allegedly killed the 58-year-old woman. The four men were docked on four counts including felony to wit murder, murder, kidnapping. At the sitting of the court, it was observed that the four culprits had no legal representation.  Chief Magistrate Victoria Bob-Manuel, the trial judge in the case, agreed that since the suspects had no legal representation they should be remanded in the prison custody pending legal advice from the Department of Public Prosecution. Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General in the state, Adekola Olawoye, said government would ensure justice prevails at the end of the case. He said, "It is our duty at the Ministry of Justice to see that we keep due diligence to the prosecution of the case." Counsel to the Olakunrin family, Sola Ebiseni, said they were ready to work with government in ensuring that the deceased got justice. The court adjourned the case for further hearing until June 2020. Officials of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control were called to administer Coronavirus test on the suspects before they were moved to the correctional centre.
