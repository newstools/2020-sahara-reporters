Commissioner Danga  Commissioner for Water Resources in Kogi State, Abdulmumuni Danga, has brutalised and allegedly raped a lady for calling him out on Facebook. The lady, identified as Elizabeth, had urged the commissioner on Facebook to assist his sister and family financially. The post did not go down well with Danga, who hired thugs to kidnap Elizabeth from her home with her three-year-old son. Speaking with SaharaReporters, Elizabeth said she decided to make the post following series of complaints by the commissioner’s sister to her. She said, “I saw a post by a local comedian of the commissioner sharing food and his family are complaining that he doesn’t attend to them, that was why I made the post. “On the 29th of March, I made a post about the commissioner. 

Facebook Post “After making the post, they started attacking me on social media and he sent some guys to come and get me. “On getting to me, they flogged me. He flogged me himself, stripped me naked and made a video of me threatening to post it when next I make any public comment about it. “They also made me apologise that what I said about him was not true under duress. I had to do so because they were all over me. “The commissioner also smashed my phone and destroyed it totally, saying that maybe I might have been recording what was happening or I have been recording before getting there.” In a video of the apology sighted by SaharaReporters, it could be seen that Elizabeth and the commissioner's sister were both teary while being recorded.
