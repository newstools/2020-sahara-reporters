 Melinda, wife of Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, has expressed deep concerns on the damage being caused by Coronavirus, warning that the pandemic could leave a high number of deaths in Africa. At the moment, there are about 13,814 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 52 countries across Africa, with over 747 deaths, according to Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Gates, while speaking on a CNN programme on Monday, called on African states to act quickly to halt the spread of the pandemic. She said, “It’s going to be horrible in the developing world. "Part of the reasons you are seeing the case numbers still do not look very bad is because they don’t have access to many tests. Look at what is happening in Ecuador, they are putting bodies out on the streets; you are going to see that in countries in Africa. “When I saw what China had to do to isolate the enormous part of its population, my first thought was Africa. How in the world are they going to deal with this? “I have been in townships all over Africa and slums. When we talk about physical distancing and hand-washing, if you live in slums you can’t physically distance, you have to go out and get your meals. You don’t have clean water to wash your hands.”
