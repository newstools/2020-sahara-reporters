 Speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has protested the inhuman treatment of Nigerians in China by Chinese officials. Amidst the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, several videos have emerged showing Chinese Government harassing Nigerians and other Africans after claiming they were the ones importing the virus into the Asian country. Gbajabiamila, at meeting with the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Zhou Pingjian, on Saturday, said that the inhuman treatment of Nigerians in China must be addressed forthwith.

The Speaker’s reaction followed a viral video showing a Nigerian High Commission official expressing discomfort at the way Nigerians were being maltreated and forced into quarantine in China despite showing no trace of the virus. Angered by that incident, some Nigerian back home have demanded for similar harsh treatments of Chinese nationals living in Nigeria. Chinese Government officials have however, pledged to look into the matter and have it resolved.
