 The Ondo State Government has shut down all markets including the ones selling essential commodities in the state. The government said the closure was part of measures to stem the spread of Coronavirus pandemic in the country. In a statement, the Ondo Government said, “It has been observed that residents have flagrantly disobeyed this directive which is a potent measure to avoid the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. “Compelled by this unwholesome infraction, government hereby places a total ban on all markets across Ondo State. “This ban is irrespective of any item. For emphasis, all markets must remain closed until further notice.” In a related development, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu has ordered the fumigation of all markets and motor parks across the state. He said, “By the time people return to the markets after the closure, they will meet the place cleaner and already fumigated.”
