 Nigerians on Twitter and other social media platforms have launched stunning attacks on comedian, Ayo Makun widely known as AY, for defending Funke Akindele, a Nollywood star, who broke a ban on gathering of more than 20 persons put in place by the Lagos State Government. Akindele, had while celebrating the birthday of her husband, AbdulRasheed Bello, invited several guests to their house last weekend including musician, Naira Marley, and a former governorship aspirant in Lagos, Babatunde Gbadamosi. Angered by the situation, Nigerians took to social media to lambast the couple for breaking the law, forcing the police in Lagos to move for their arrest. On Monday, a Lagos State Magistrates’ Court in Ogba found the couple guilty of violating the lockdown rule, ordering them to serve a 14-day community service and pay a fine of N100,000 each. Marley and Gbadamosi have also been picked up by the police in Lagos and a verdict is being expected on their case. However, reacting to the issue on his Twitter handle on Tuesday, AY berated Nigerians for condemning Akindele when they should have channelled their energy to tackle political leaders in the country, who are their real oppressors, according to him. The entertainer went on to express optimism that Akindele will overcome her present challenge. He said, “Yes! Nobody is above the law. But I wish those of you who called out @funkeakindele can do same with your countless oppressors in government. “Even when the sky is filled with clouds, the sun still shines above. Funke will rise again. #Lessonslearnt.” YES! NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW. BUT I WISH THOSE OF YOU WHO CALLED OUT @funkeakindele CAN DO SAME WITH YOUR COUNTLESS OPPRESSORS IN GOVERNMENT... EVEN WHEN THE SKY IS FILLED WITH CLOUDS THE SUN STILL SHINES ABOVE. FUNKE WILL RISE AGAIN.#LESSONSLEARNT  But not willing to take the jibe from AY, Nigerians on Twitter fired missiles back at him. Responding, Mayowa Olagunju said, “Who told him that we don't like Funke Akindele. What she did was wrong. She did the right thing at the wrong time.” In his own reaction, Wale Adetona said, “Coming from someone who has never used his platform to champion any advocacy or voiced out against bad governance. Go and sit down oga!” Adding his voice to the issue, Alàgbà Dòtun, another Twitter user, said, “Not all celebrities are sensible. “Your friend did the wrong thing, still got the balls to post it on social media and you here to say what is not. “Had it been it was one normal street guy that did this, they’ll use him to preach but they don't want to be used to preach.” Not all the celebrities are sensible, olohun Your friend did the wrong thing, still got the balls to post it on SM and you here to say what is notHad it been na one normal street guy do this shit, they use him to preach but they don't want to be used to preach  A young lady named Mamuzo in her own submission, said, “AY, if I had the audience you have, I’d do my hundred points symbol to drag the government to do better. “Sadly, we don’t even see you championing any campaign against bad governance. You are rich and privileged but you are not in any way fit to criticise anyone here.” AY, if I had the audience you have, Iâd do my ð¯ to drag the government to do better. Sadly we donât even see you championing any campaign against bad governance. You are rich and privileged now but you are not in anyway fit to criticize anyone here.  Another Twitter user, Iyalaya, said, “How many times have you spoken against these oppressors you mentioned, Mr table for N5.1m.” Same oppresors that u beg for your show to be successful...#hypocrite  Lanre Bam while knocking AY for his comments, said, “The oppressors that usually seat at the VVIP of your show? “When some of them attend your next show, kindly repeat this message to their ears.” The Oppressors that usually seats at the VVIP of your show? When some of them attend your next show,Kindly repeat this message to their ears  Known for staging his widely followed 'AY Live' comedy show across and beyond Nigeria, the entertainer is considered by many citizens to be friends with dozens of the country's thieving politicians, who spend millions to attend his events. As a result, he is always reluctant to condemn them even when they commit acts against members of the public. Many in this category see AY as a man only interested in growing his business and brand but unwilling to speak for the oppressed in the society, hence their attack on him on Twitter on Tuesday.
