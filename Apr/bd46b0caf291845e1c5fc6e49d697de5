 The Coalition of Northern Groups has called on state governors in Nigeriaâ€™s Northern region to stop showing less concern to the fight against Coronavirus in the country. The group in a statement by Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, its spokesperson, on Wednesday said the governors now demanding palliatives would mismanage any resource allocated to them just like they did with bailout funds intended for the payment of salary arrears to workers. The statement reads, "CNG frowns at the incoherent response to the COVID-19 by most Northern state governments that only pay lip service to the issue of provision of equipped isolation and treatment centres and palliatives to communities affected by their lockdown orders. "We frown at the focus of the Northern governors on demanding for funds from the federation account under the pretext of fighting the spread of the pandemic. "In this regard, CNG recalls the scandalous controversies that trailed the squander of bailout grants for the settlement of salary arrears by most state governments. "We urge the Federal Government not to succumb to the states' demand for funds for fear that they would not be put to judicious use as with the salary bailouts. "And if the Federal Government is disposed to granting the funds to the states, CNG insists on the setting up of a mechanism in the form of committee comprising of credible elders and community leaders in each state to monitor the process of the disbursements and ensuring the judicious use of the funds for the purpose they are meant. "CNG notes that just like the Federal Government, the palliatives offered by the state governments are equally inadequate and non-transparently distributed and must be reviewed immediately."
