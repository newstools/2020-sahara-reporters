It is suspected that he contracted Coronavirus there because there was a large crowd and people didn’t observe social distancing there. “It is a painful loss for the family,” the source said. In 1979, Goni was elected as the first civilian governor of the former Borno State on the platform of the Great Nigeria Peoples Party and was in office from October 1979 to September 1983.
