Mohammed, son of Nigeria’s ex-Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has recovered from Coronavirus. His recovery came more than one month after he tested positive for the deadly virus. Thanking Nigerians for their support after being discharged from hospital, Mohammed said that he will keep praying for the recovery of others still battling the virus. He said, “I thank the Almighty Allah for my recovery from the dreaded infection and also wish to express my sincere and deep appreciation to Nigerians for their prayers and goodwill while I was being treated. “In the course of life, we have no idea of what will happen to us because only the Almighty God knows our future. “When COVID-19 first broke out in China, I had no idea that I might be one of those to be infected. This is one of the everlasting lessons I can’t forget for the rest of my life. “I have been humbled by this experience. Words cannot sufficiently convey the depth of my joy over my recovery and discharge. “Since I tested positive after my return from abroad and my isolation for treatment, I was inundated with incredible expressions of goodwill by Nigerians. “This pandemic has united the rich and the poor and, indeed, the rest of the world against this novel lethal virus that has caused economic and social disruptions globally. “This is the time our policy makers should reset our national priorities and give our health system adequate attention. No investment in our health sector is too much.”
