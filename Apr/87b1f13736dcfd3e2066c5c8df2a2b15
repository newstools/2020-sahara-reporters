The Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to ease the 14-day total lockdown imposed on the state. Buhari had on Monday during a nationwide broadcast ordered a total lockdown on Kano following the rise of COVID-19 cases and the strange deaths in the state. Ganduje, while speaking on Thursday, while inaugurating a panel of experts to support the state task force technical committee, said it is important to relax the lockdown for a while in order to ease the hardship in the state, especially in the holy month of Ramadan. He said, “We would engage the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to seek permission to relax the total lockdown imposed on Kano.
