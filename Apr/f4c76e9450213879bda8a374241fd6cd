 The police in Lagos have refused to release the General Overseer, Resurrection Praise Ministries for Africa, Bishop Samson Benjamin, who was arrested on Wednesday and charged to the Igbosere Magistrate Court for protesting the ill treatment of Nigerians in China in front of the Chinese Embassy in Victoria Island. Benjamin during the protest said that it was unacceptable for the Chinese, who caused the outbreak of Coronavirus to be enjoying royal treatment in Nigeria while Nigerians and other Africans in China were being humiliated and dehumanised for no reason. Following his arrest by the police allegedly on the orders of the embassy, the cleric was taken to the Force Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba, before being hurriedly arraigned at the Igbosere Magistrate Court where he was eventually granted bail in the sum of N1m with two sureties in like sum. Benjamin was accused of violating the lockdown order put in place by President Muhammadu Buhari in Lagos, Ogun and Federal Capital Territory to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country. A senior member of the cleric’s church told SaharaReporters on Wednesday evening that despite meeting the bail condition set by the court, the police is yet to release him. “Bishop has met all the conditions of bail but the police is still refusing to release him and we don't know why,” the source said.
