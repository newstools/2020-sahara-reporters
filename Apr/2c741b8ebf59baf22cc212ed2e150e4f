Makama said, "We have warned them (officers) several times but whoever that does that now is doing so at his own peril. "I am sure they are aware of what happened to the officers that were caught in Lagos and whoever that is seen would be dealt with accordingly.” Speaking further, the Zone XI AIG said the police was already ensuring that criminal elements including miscreants don’t perpetrate evil during this period. He said, “While we are ensuring this, we would make sure that nobody's right is trampled upon and we also make sure that the instructions are followed for our good and in the interest of the state.”
