Garba Shehu, Presidential spokesperson, on Wednesday said the result of the autopsies must be accepted by all and not be used to play politics.

"There is much that remains unknown about this virus. What we do know is that global infections rates continue to rise each day, even when in some nations affected some time before Nigeria, the daily rate of infection is now slowing.
