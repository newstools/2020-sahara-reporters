  Former governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun, has donated N25m to the state in support of the fight against Coronavirus (COVID-19). Amosun becomes the latest individual to donate to the fight against the spread of the virus in the state. Ogun has restricted entry into the state and is set to go on lockdown on April 3, 2020. Amosun said he made the donation to the bank account of the state in a letter to the governor, tagging it as a personal contribution. “Please be informed that the sum of N25m has been transferred and cleared into the Access Bank Account (No 1384210113 Ogun Coalition Against COVID-19) as my personal contribution to the management of COVID-19 challenge in Ogun. “I am in constant touch with federal agencies in and outside Ogun with a view to offering maximum assistance to our people in these trying times. “In addition, arrangements are also in place to assist in ameliorating the challenges arising from the lockdown in Ogun within the period by supporting 25,000 households across the state. “It is my fervent prayer that the Almighty God will see our people in Ogun and indeed Nigeria through the COVID-19 pandemic,” the letter read.
