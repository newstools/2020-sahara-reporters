Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, has suspended the Lawan of Kadi Village under Fika Local Government Area, Abubakar Lumo Kadi, for complaining about acute water scarcity in his domain and urging government to do something urgent about it. The suspension order was handed through Emir of Gudi, who is said to have acted based on the instruction received from Governor Buni. Residents of Kadi have been suffering the lack of water in the area for a long time, SaharaReporters gathered. The situation has in fact affected the education of many children in the community, who have abandoned school to most times go in search of water for the use of their households.
