 A group has deployed a new emergency response app – PrimeAlert – for free to assist the Nigeria Center for Disease Control in reporting cases and symptoms of COVID-19 in any part of the country. The app, expected to serve as emergency tool, can be downloaded on the mobile phones to enable Nigerians report any suspected case of Coronavirus around them. Developer of the app, Tony Nwulu, made the disclosure on Thursday in Abuja. He said the gesture was aimed at supporting government’s fight against the pandemic. Nwulu said, “We urge everyone to download PrimeAlert app. We have updated the app to serve as a vital emergency tool for humanity in view of the Coronavirus pandemic that has plagued the world.” Speaking further, Nwulu said that the new technology will help Nigerians report robbery, kidnapping, theft, accident or any life threatening circumstance.
