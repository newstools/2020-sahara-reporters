  Two policemen in Osun State have been arrested for openly assaulting a woman with whips at Odo Ori Market in the Iwo area of the state. In the video of the incident that has since gone viral on the Internet, the two policemen could be seen repeatedly flogging the woman with whips in their hands and only halted their assault after the intervention of some of their colleagues minutes later. Angered by the situation following outrage by Nigerians, who had seen the video, the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, ordered the arrest of the officers for disciplinary action.
