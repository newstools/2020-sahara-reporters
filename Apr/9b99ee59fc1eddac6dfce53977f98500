  The Nigerian Government has introduced mobile testing and treatment vehicles to be used for combating Coronavirus in rural communities in the country. Inspecting a prototype of the testing vehicle, Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, and members of the Senate Committee on Science and Technology, described the new innovation as  a ‘game-changer’ in the campaign against COVID-19. The mobile testing vehicles were conceptualised as part of the ‘Telemedicine Project for Rural Medical Services’ initiated by the National Space Research and Development Agency. It is equipped with a bed, waiting room and laboratory testing facilities. Onu said, “This is a game-changer – this is essentially taking the hospital to the home with the facility we have here." Acting Director-General of NASRDA, Jonathan Angulu, explained that the agency planned to take the telemedicine project to the 774 local government areas in the country.
