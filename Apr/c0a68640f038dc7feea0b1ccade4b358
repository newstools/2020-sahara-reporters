  The Nigerian Government has cancelled an evacuation flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, after citizens, who indicated interest in returning to Nigeria had paid for air tickets. The citizens desire to return to Nigeria following the outbreak of Coronavirus across the world and the damage it was causing. It was gathered that the decision to cancel the flight was taken without recourse to those that had bought tickets or any explanation for the move by the government. The situation has left many Nigerians stranded and angry in the Arabian country. The stranded persons all paid N265,000 for an economy return ticket on Emirates Airline to facilitate their return, one of them told SaharaReporters on Friday. Trouble however, started when Emirates Airline reached out to evacuees on Thursday to inform them of the cancellation of the scheduled flight to Nigeria without explanation. He said, "We received a message from Emirates Airline yesterday saying our flight had been cancelled. "When we reached out to the airline to find out why, we were told that the Nigerian Embassy requested the cancellation of the flight. "We want to go back home, we are stranded, we don't have money to pay rent again. "We used our last cash to buy tickets and now we have nowhere to go."
