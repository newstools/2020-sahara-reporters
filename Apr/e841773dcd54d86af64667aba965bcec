Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu  The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has cautioned officers and men of the Nigeria Police Force currently deployed for the enforcement of the lockdown and social restriction orders to ensure that the rights of Nigerians are not infringed upon under any pretext. Also, persons on essential duties duly exempted from the restriction orders should be accorded due courtesies and unfettered access to and fro their places of duty, Adamu said. In a statement by Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, Adamu said all police officers deployed for the enforcement of the restriction order must be professional, humane and tactful and must show utmost respect to the citizenry. The statement reads, "To this end, the IGP has directed Command Commissioners of Police to immediately commence conduct monitoring of police officers deployed on enforcement duties in their areas of responsibilities. "The IGP has equally charged Zonal Assistant Inspectors-General of Police across the nation to ensure adequate supervision of personnel under their watch, as well as due compliance with the standard operating procedure guiding this special task. "The AIGs and CPs are also to ensure robust anti-crime patrols and surveillance around vulnerable targets such as medical facilities, shops and markets, residential areas, financial institutions and Automated Teller Machines points, amongst others so that criminals do not take undue advantage of the current COVID-19 challenge to perpetrate crimes against the citizenry."
