 President of the United States, Donald Trump, has said that he would temporarily suspend all immigration to America due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus has killed more than 42,000 people in the US, while there are more than 766,660 infections of the virus in the country. The State Department issued around 462,000 immigrant visas in the 2019 fiscal year, while US Citizens and Immigration Services granted permanent residence to nearly 577,000 individuals. In a tweet, Trump said, “In light of the attack from the invisible enemy as well as the need to protect the jobs of our great American citizens, I will be signing an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States.” In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!  The move, Trump said, was targeted at protecting American jobs, many of which have been lost since state-wide lockdowns was instituted to slow the spread of the pandemic.
