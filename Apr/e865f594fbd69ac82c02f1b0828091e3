 A former Commissioner for Sports in Ogun State, Bukola Olopade, has announced his recovery from Coronavirus. This comes three weeks after Olapade said he had contracted the infection. In a video posted online, Olopade said, “Three weeks ago, I was diagnosed with COVID-19 and I made a video where I explained to the whole world what had happened. I did the video for a reason, that’s to be responsible for those I have had contacts with, which are a lot of people.
