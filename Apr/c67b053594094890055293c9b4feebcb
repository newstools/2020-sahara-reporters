There is currently panic at Kuje Prison, Abuja, after an inmate died of a strange illness on Monday morning. According to findings by SaharaReporters, news of the death has left officials and inmates in great fear especially following the outbreak of Coronavirus in Nigeria and fears that it could spread to all corners including correctional centres. The inmate was said to have died around 10:00am on Monday under suspicious circumstances and was later moved to Gwagwalada Specialist Hospital. “He has been having underlining issues for the past one year. His situation deteriorated last four days with sneezing and basal discharge. “He just died around 10:00am this morning and was moved to Gwagwalada Specialist Hospital. “Though the prison management claimed that he had HIV but there is no record of medication. “We are not safe here in Kuje. We are suspecting he may have died of Coronavirus,” an official told SaharaReporters. Calls and a text message put across to the spokesperson for the Nigerian Correctional Services, Mr Francis Enobore, over the issue were not answered as at the time of this report. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had on April 9 granted pardon and clemency to 2,600 inmates of custodial centres across the country as part of measures to control the spread of Coronavirus in Nigeria.
