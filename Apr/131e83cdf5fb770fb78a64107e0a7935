 Bayelsa State Government has relaxed its COVID-19 lockdown for Easter to enable Christians fully participate in the celebration. This followed an appeal by the state organs of the various Christian bodies. Governor Douye Diri stated this during an enlarged meeting with members of the COVID-19 Task Force, security agencies and leadership of the Christian and Muslim communities at the Government House, Yenagoa, the state capital. In a statement by his Acting Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, the governor said churches with large congregation would be permitted to have 50 persons during services while 20 worshippers would be allowed for smaller churches. He cautioned them to adhere strictly to all the preventive measures including social distancing of at least two metres and washing of hands with soap and water. The governor noted that after the Easter, the lockdown would revert to status quo to ensure public health and prevention of the COVID-19 in the state. He said the stay-at-home order for civil servants and all other earlier measures have been extended for another two weeks, pointing out that they would be reviewed every two weeks until the COVID-19 crisis abates. Diri also hinted that as part of efforts to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, oil multinational, AGIP in conjunction with its joint venture partners was going to site its health facility in the South-South zone towards combating viral infections. He directed the Ministry of Lands to make land available for the project.
