Two officers of the Nigerian Army and two policemen have tested positive for Coronavirus in Borno State. The four are among the 30 confirmed cases in the state. A source told SaharaReporters that two of the cases were recorded at the 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital in Maimalari Cantonment, Maiduguri, the state capital, while the remaining cases were at Pulka, a town under Gwoza Local Government Area. “On April 21, one Nigeria Police personnel, Cpl Yola Emmanuel (NPF500251) serving under 22 Bde, reported at 7 Division Medical Services and Hospital in Maimalari Cantonment, a test was run on him and the result turned positive. “On April 26, a soldier, Sergeant Michael Ahmadu (97NA/45/6722) and Mrs Rahab A. Augustine, who are both staff of 7DMSH, tested positive to the COVID 19. Contact tracing has been activated. “Families of the confirmed patients and all 7DMSH staff who came in contact with the patients are been quarantined. “More isolation wards to hold suspected cases are being provided,” the source said. SaharaReporters gathered that another soldier and a policeman also tested positive for COVID-19 in Pulka. The two, who are presently being treated in the town, are likely contact of the state index patient that died of the virus. The index case, a 56-year-old nurse working for Medicine Sans Frontier in Pulka, died on April 19. “With this development, I think it’s time for the management of 7DMSH to adequately train it's personnel on handling of COVID-19 patients and this should be escalated to the level of the NAMC. “HQ TC should ensure enforcement of preventive measures in all units across the theatre. Comds/COs should ensure social distancing for troops on parade or in operation,” the source added.
