  Kwara State has recorded two new Coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of confirmed infections in the state to 11. Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq announced this on Thursday in Ilorin, the state capital, during the flag-off of the biometric registration of transporters slated to receive soft loans to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown. According to the AbdulRazaq, the two new cases were contacts of previous confirmed cases. The governor said that the internal restriction on vehicular movements in the state remains in force, while government will step up measures to gradually lift the restrictions and rejuvenate the economy, including the mandatory use of face masks. He said, “The lockdown for another two weeks is to reduce the number of cases. As you can see, Kano is going up; Lagos is going up. Even in Kwara, we have two more new cases. “So there is the need for boundaries to be locked down. Essentially, each state has different policies on lockdown but we want to ensure that people are not moving across boundaries to transmit the virus.”
