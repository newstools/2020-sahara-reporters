 Nigerian musician, Azeez Fashola widely known as Naira Marley, and a former governorship aspirant in Lagos, Babatunde Gbadamosi, have written letters of apology to the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Naira Marley, Gbadamosi and his wife were on Wednesday charged before the Lagos State Magistrates’ Court in Ogba for attending a birthday party in violation of government’s social distancing directive to check the spread of Coronavirus. The case was later withdrawn on the condition that the defendants tendered an apology to President Muhammadu Buhari and Sanwo-Olu.
