 The National Human Rights Commission has expressed concern over the alleged maltreatment of Nigerians and Africans in Guangzhou and other parts of China. The commission described the ejection of Nigerians from their homes and hotels by Chinese officials as acts of discrimination and a gross violation of human rights. This was contained in a statement issued by the Executive Secretary of the commission, Tony Ojukwu, on Saturday. The statement added that the action was capable of rendering Nigerians stateless in a time of global emergency when nations were evacuating their nationals to safety. It reads, “Reports of ejection of Nigerians from their homes and hotels by Chinese authorities are clearly acts of discrimination and a gross violation of human rights. “The Commission also notes with concern the reports of seizure of international passports belonging to Nigerians. “This is a not only a violation of international human rights norms but one that is capable of rendering Nigerians stateless in a time of global emergency when nations are evacuating their nationals to safety. “The alleged maltreatment of Nigerians during an outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic when nations of the world are coalescing in unprecedented acts of solidarity and commitments should be condemned in all forms.” The NHRC called on the Nigerian Government to take immediate steps in reaching out to the Chinese Government to put a stop to the harassment of Nigerians, Africans and indeed any citizen of the world in the guise of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. It added, “In particular, we urge the Government of Nigeria to take all necessary steps to evacuate Nigerians willing to come home from China and other countries where they are currently at risk of discrimination or any form of racial abuse as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.”
