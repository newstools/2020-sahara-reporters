 Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, has called for calm among residents after the first case of Coronavirus was recorded in the state. Akeredolu, who spoke in a television broadcast, said there was no need for panic as his administration was already working to curtail the spread of the virus. He said the military officer, who tested positive for Coronavirus, had been in isolation since his return to the state from India. Akeredolu said, "Only one case; I can assure you that it will not be more than this but whatever happens we will take it. "So, don't be anxious and let us observe the social and physical distancing. The people should not cluster together." The governor further noted that a palliative committee had been established to cushion the effects of the movement restriction currently in place in the state on the people. Earlier, Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, disclosed that all those, who had made contact with the confirmed case, are being traced in order to prevent a spread of the virus.
