 China has recorded no Covid-19 death for the first time since January, 2020. On Tuesday, the National Health Commission reported 32 new cases across China, all of which were arrivals from another country. There were also 30 new asymptomatic cases reported. However, for the first time since the commission began publishing its figures in January, there were no new deaths reported. The government had restricted entry of foreigners into the country as concerns over a second wave of infections rise. Cases in mainland China have been dropping since March, but it is among several Asian nations facing a second wave of infections brought in from overseas. On Monday the government said it would increase measures at land borders where the number of cases detected were exceeding those recorded at airports. It also announced it would indefinitely extend its ban on foreigners entering or transiting. China has reported a total of 81,740 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 3,331 deaths.
