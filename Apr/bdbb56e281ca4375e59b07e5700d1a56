The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has advised Nigerians not to use non-medical face masks, saying it does not prevent the spread of COVID-19. The agency made the clarification on its official Twitter page following the local production of different customised non-medical face masks by Nigerians. In a statement, the agency said, “Simple test: If wearer can put off a flame from a cigarette lighter that is placed in front of the wearer, the mask is protective enough.


Google "Barrier face masks do not prevent you from contracting the disease but they have been found to contribute to reduce spread of infections when used widely in conjunction with other measures. "Such measures include social distancing, not touching the face, eyes or mouth, washing of hands with soap for 20 seconds or use of alcohol based hand sanitizers.” The agency warned that non-medical face masks made of cloth are not standardised for use in health care settings or by professionals.
