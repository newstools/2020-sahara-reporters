Doctors at the Specialist Hospital, Edo State, have been accused of abandoning their duty posts over fears of contracting Coronavirus while attending to some patients. A video seen by SaharaReporters showed officials telling patients that doctors were not available to attend to them. A patient, who was visibly angered by the situation, said, "They are telling us that there is no doctor, this is the card room but they are not giving us card, the place is locked up.  “There is emergency here. We are not going anywhere." A source disclosed that many of the patients with medical conditions, who thronged the facility, were having minor cases. He added that their cases were not related to COVID-19 but wondered why the doctors decided to stay away from their duty post. SaharaReporters had recently reported how Nigerians have been resorting to self-medication following the reluctance of doctors and hospitals to attend to patients over fears of contracting the deadly virus.
