"He’s incompetent, he lacks the spirit of leadership. Ganduje is just like a toy to the FG; he does as they say because he has no choice. The testing center is down for three days. The NCDC in Kano is not functional." The fact that they put Ganduje in power by force proves the point. Heâs incompetent, he lacks the spirit of leadership.

Kano was quick to dismiss a sitting Emir. Kano was quick to exonerate the governor despite video evidence of stealing money. 640 people have died in 7days. Kano has no plan and is not quick to do anything." @sir_balemoh wrote, "This is unfortunate and heartbreaking; leaders fail to understand that they swore by the holy book to secure the lives and property of the citizens they govern. Ganduje and the NCDC are failing in Kano."
