 Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has said that about 40 health workers have tested positive for Coronavirus in the country. Giving updates on Thursday during the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 briefing, the minister urged frontline workers to always protect themselves when treating patients. The minister noted that Nigeria recorded 91 new infections on Wednesday, out of which 74 cases were confirmed in Lagos. He said, “I applaud all our health workers in the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government will continue to provide you with the necessary protective equipment. “I urge you all to take all the necessary precautions for your own safety, please do not try to treat patients without using adequate PPE. “Frontline workers must undertake refresher courses training in IPC at intervals. This advice is necessary due to the number of health workers who have tested positive – they are over 40 now.”
