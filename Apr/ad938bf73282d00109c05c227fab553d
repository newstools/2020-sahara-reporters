 Lawmaker representing Kano North Senatorial district at the National Assembly, Barau Jibrin, has called on the Nigerian Government to urgently assist the Kano State Government in curb the rising cases of Coronavirus in the city. The senator said there was the need for President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to support Kano with funds, medical equipment and testing facilities to tackle the situation. According to Jibrin, the support will not only benefit the people of Kano but also other states in the Northern region of the country equally battling the pandemic. He said, “The COVID-19 pandemic is such that no state government can effectively deal with it alone without the assistance of the Federal Government no matter how rich and developed such state is.” Jibrin urged the Federal Government not wait until the virus spreads beyond the capability of the state government before coming in. Kano has 73 Coronavirus cases so far and one recorded death. However, in recent days over 150 persons have been reported to have died from a mysterious ailment with symptoms related to malaria.
