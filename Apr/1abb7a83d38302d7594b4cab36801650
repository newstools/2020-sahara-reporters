Mr Raymond Dokpesi Jnr., son of the founder of DAAR Communications Plc, has tested positive for Coronavirus. The younger Dokpesi, who is now chairman of the organisation, disclosed this in a short message to members of staff in Abuja on Monday. He said, “I got a call this morning confirming the result is COVID-19 positive. I am leaving now to the Gwagwalada Isolation Centre for treatment and hope to be back in two weeks. “Many of you may have interacted with me during our various meetings and I would advise you to get tested as soon as possible.” Meanwhile, the contact tracing team of the NCDC is to begin a test of persons, who may have had contact with Dokpesi in the past two weeks as well as all other members of staff.
