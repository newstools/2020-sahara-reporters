A group, the Ilaje Advancement Forum, has called on the Ondo State Government to investigate the activities of some Nigerian Navy personnel at the Forward Operating Base in the Ilaje area of the state. The group said the atrocities of the naval personnel mostly in the Igbokoda area of Ilaje, which led to the deliberate burning down of a medicine store belonging to Mrs Taiwo Menukoro, called for urgent attention by the authorities. In a statement by its moderators, Olajuwon Daodu and Fadesola Ojamoni, the IAF asked the state government to set up a judicial committee of enquiry to investigate the destruction of the medicine store. The statement reads, "We plead with Ondo State Government to set up an independent judicial committee of enquiry to look into this matter and ascertain the veracity of the claims of the poor woman with a view to mitigating the economic hardship imposed on her family by the alleged arson. "It is not correct that Mrs Taiwo sells petrol or diesel in the pharmacy/provision shop, neither was she cooking at that time. "We can confirm that Mrs Taiwo uses that shop as both accommodation and business after she lost her residence to the flood that overwhelmed Igbokoda in April 2019. "We wish to clarify that the statement credited to Major General John Enenche, Defence Media Operations, is not only wrong but an attempt to cheat Mrs Menukoro. "We visited the scene, took video recordings of the remnants of the burnt shop and can confirm the shop had no back door. "We are at an austere period where government is giving palliatives to citizens, we do not expect the Nigerian Navy officials to be complicit in the destruction of properties in the midst of a ravaging COVID-19 menace. "In the spirit of fairness, we believe Mrs Taiwo Menukuro deserves a fair hearing on this matter."
