President Muhammadu Buhari will again address Nigerians today to give an update on the outbreak of Coronavirus in the country. Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said the address would be broadcast by 8:00pm. He said, "President Muhammadu Buhari will address the nation Monday, April 27, 2020 at 8:00pm. "Television, radio and other electronic media stations are enjoined to hook up to the network services of the Nigerian Television Authority and Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria respectively for the broadcast." During his last broadcast two weeks ago, Buhari ordered the extension of the lockdown by 14-days but not many Nigerians adhered to that directive.
