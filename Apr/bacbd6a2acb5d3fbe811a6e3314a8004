The Republic of Germany said it has granted Nigeria debt relief amounting to N8.9bn (€22.4m) on account of the Coronavirus pandemic. Also, the German Government said it had successfully campaigned in the G20 group of countries and the Paris Club group of creditor countries in favour of a debt moratorium for countries heavily affected by the economic impact of COVID-19. The European economic powerhouse stated this in a statement on Tuesday. It noted, “In 2020, the German treasury relieves Nigeria of debt repayments amounting to €22.4m (N8.9bn). “This comes in addition to Germany’s support to the COVID-19 response on a global level and the support provided by the European Union to partner countries in Africa worth €3.25bn (N1.3trn). “On April 27, Germany pledged €300m (N120bn) to the global humanitarian response plan launched by the United Nations to fight COVID-19.”
