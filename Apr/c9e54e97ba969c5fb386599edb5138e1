 50 A30 ventilators and personal protective supplies donated by the United Nations COVID-19 Basket Fund have arrived Nigeria. The shipment, which arrived the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport on Wednesday, is to be distributed to states across the country. In a statement by Oluseyi Soremekun, National Information Officer, UNIC Nigeria, the UN said more equipment would arrive this month. The statement reads, "The consignment (that is likely to be the first of several to come) includes 50 A30 ventilators and personal protective supplies procured with funds from the recently launched COVID-19 Basket Fund, including $2m mobilised within the UN system in Nigeria and a $200,000 contribution from APM Terminals. "The arrival of the medical equipment and supplies will be a boost to government’s efforts to provide an efficient and effective healthcare response for those affected by the virus. “The supplies will be deployed around the country to health facilities in most need due to the outbreak, and coordination structures are already in place between government and the UN to ensure urgent deployment.” Edward Kallon, United Nations Resident Coordinator for Nigeria, said the COVID-19 Basket Fund will provide support for Nigeria's health care system expected to come under immense pressure in the coming weeks. He said, “The world is in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. The spread of COVID-19 is expected to put immense pressure on Nigeria’s healthcare system. “The UN in Nigeria is actively mobilising resources in support of government's national response strategy of containing the pandemic and adequately caring for those confirmed to have the virus."
