Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, has relaxed the lockdown order in the state from 6:00am on Thursday to 12:00am on Friday. The move, according to the governor, was to allow people prepare adequately for the approaching Ramadan fast. He said, “Probably, we are giving a grace period of some hours so that people would be able to do some purchases because of Ramadan that is coming up probably on Friday.” Kano so far has 73 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with one recorded death. However, in recent days over 150 persons have been reported to have died from a mysterious ailment in the city with symptoms related to malaria.
