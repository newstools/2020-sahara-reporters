The Delta State Government has commended the Nigerian Army high command for arresting two soldiers shown in a viral video threatening to rape and infect women in Warri with HIV over the alleged killing of their colleague. The state's Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, who earlier described the video first published by SaharaReporters as "fake", commended the army in a statement on Saturday. Aniagwu said that no soldier was killed in Warri and that government was concerned about where the soldiers got their information that warranted their using uncouth and uncivilised language in threatening the people of Warri. The soldiers were reportedly arrested at 9 Brigade Military Cantonment, Ikeja, Lagos, on Friday.
