The legal team of Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, has filed a motion asking the High Court in Kaduna to quash all charges against him. El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat, have been detained by the Nigerian Government since 2015 after hundreds of his followers were killed by the Nigerian Army in Zaria, Kaduna State. In the motion filed by rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), on behalf of El-Zakzaky, deposed to by Muhammad Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, son of the detained IMN leader, and served on the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ministry of Justice of Kaduna, he asked the court to dismiss the case after the stateâ€™s failure to disclose the offences preferred against his client.
