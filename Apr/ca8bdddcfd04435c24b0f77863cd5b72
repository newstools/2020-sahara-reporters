 A large number of women in Sapele, Delta State, on Wednesday took to the streets in a peaceful demonstration to express their displeasure at the extension of movement restriction by the state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa. The two-week extension is to further help curb the spread of Coronavirus in the state. Okowa had on Tuesday announced the extension of the sit-at-home order and dusk to dawn curfew to tackle the pandemic. SaharaReporters reliably gathered that the protesting women, who were joined by youths in the area, said they were voicing out their frustration because they could no longer contend with hunger in their houses. They said government had failed to provide them with palliatives to cushion the effects of the movement restriction order in place. #COVID19: Women In Sapele Protest Delta Governorâs Extension Of Lockdown Order#coronavirus #LockdownExtended #Lockdownextention @IAOkowa @NCDCgov @WHO #HealthyAtHome #StayHome #HungerVirus pic.twitter.com/THZJFV9sZ9
