  Amnesty International has asked the Nigerian Government to ensure that every citizen is free from abuse especially at the hands of security operatives during the lockdown instituted in some parts of the country to curb the spread of Coronavirus. The rights group in a statement on Monday signed by Isa Sanusi, Media Manager for Amnesty International in Nigeria, said concerned authorities must give clear instructions to security agencies not to abuse their powers.
