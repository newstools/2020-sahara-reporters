 NPower beneficiaries have asked the Nigerian Government to pay stipends to them from January till date to enable them cope with the economic demands of staying at home during the COVID-19 lockdown. The beneficiaries represented by Farouk Olaotan Shitta on Wednesday asked the Nigerian Government through the Ministry of Humanitarian Service and Disaster Management as well as National Social Investment Programme to explain if Ncreatives are part of those the government claimed to have paid. The group accused the government of reneging on its promise to train Ncreatives in camp as well as the failure to secure the stipulated two months internship placement for every beneficiary. "We have not been given certificate of completion till date neither have we been rewarded with trips to China as promised to the best beneficiaries," Shitta said. The group appealed to government to fulfil its promises and pay all beneficiaries now vulnerable due to lack of skills or revenue especially during the lockdown instituted to curtail the spread of Coronavirus.
