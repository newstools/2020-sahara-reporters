 Five medical workers at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Kwara State, have tested positive for Coronavirus. An official of the hospital told SaharaReporters that three resident doctors, one consultant and one nurse all tested positive to the virus. Recall that a senior consultant with the teaching hospital, Alakija Salami, was suspended by management of the hospital for covering up the status and death of a patient, who recently returned to Nigeria from the United Kingdom, Alhaji Muideen Obanimomo, a prominent Offa son. The patient, who died on April 3, infected his wife with the virus before his demise. It is suspected that he may have also infected the five health workers before his death. It is not yet clear how many persons had contact with the late Obanimomo before his demise.
