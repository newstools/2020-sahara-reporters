 Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has threatened to deal ruthlessly with two journalists covering the state if they continued to write reports that create ‘panic’ among the people. While handing down the warning on Wednesday, Governor Umahi also announced that the two journalists were banned from entering Government House or any government facility in the state. The two journalists are Chijioke Agwu, correspondent of Sun Newspaper in the state and Peter Okutu of Vanguard newspaper. Umahi had on Saturday ordered the arrest of Agwu over a report he did on the Lassa Fever outbreak in the state. Three days later, Okutu was arrested on the orders of Ohaukwu Local Government Area Chairman, Clement Odah, over a report he did on the alleged military invasion of Umuogodoakpu-Ngbo community in the council area. The governor said the safety of journalists in the state could no longer be guaranteed by him as the people were angry with them and might begin to unleash mayhem on them if they continued to cause ‘panic’ in the state. He said, “Ebonyi State is no longer a dumping ground. The other day, Chijioke Agwu wrote that Lassa Fever was killing Ebonyi people in droves and a few days back, Mr Peter Okutu of Vanguard did his own. “Okutu is fond of degrading Ebonyi State, and I don’t know why my officials have allowed him to continue to do that because he is not from Ebonyi State. “I want to ban him for life with Chijioke Agwu. I don’t want to see them anywhere in any government facility. “We are not begging you to give us good report because the only person that gives good or bad report is God. “We are all accountable to him. If you think that Ebonyi State is a dumping ground, try it again. “If you think you have the pen, we have the ‘koboko’. Let’s leave the court alone. Ebonyi people are very angry with the press and let me warn that I won’t be able to control them or know when they unleash mayhem on you if you continue to write to create panic in the state.”
