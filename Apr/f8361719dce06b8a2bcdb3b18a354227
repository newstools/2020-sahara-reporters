The two COVID-19 patients reported to be at large on Sunday in Maiduguri, Borno State, have been found. Commissioner for Information in the state, Babakura Abba Jato, who identified the two patients as Abbas Kaka Hassan, 24, and Hauwa Mohammed, 42, said they have been moved to an isolation centre for treatment. The commissioner said a combined team of health surveillance and investigation team backed by a police escort traced Hassan to his family house. Jato said, “The other patient, Hauwa Mohammed, a 42-year-old female, reported herself to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital following which she received apologies from laboratory officials at the UMTH and Borno’s Commissioner for Health." He added that the apology became necessary after Hauwa had protested that she did not receive communication from the COVID-19 lab at UMTH or officials of the state response team to come for isolation even though she had been self-isolating since her sample was taken for test.
