 Chief Judge of Bayelsa State, Justice Kate Abiri, has ordered the immediate release of eight prisoners from the Medium Security Custodian Centre, Okaka in Yenagoa, the state capital, in an attempt to decongest the facility. Justice Abiri however, called on judges in the state to appropriate machinery for the speedy disposition of criminal matters especially for those awaiting trial. She said that some inmates awaiting trial ought not to remain in custody where matters for which they were charged was not murder or armed robbery, adding that where it is discovered thatÂ  the prosecution of the cases were moving at slow pace or not heard at all for one reason or the other, bail could be granted.
