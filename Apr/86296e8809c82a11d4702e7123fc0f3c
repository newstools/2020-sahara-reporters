 Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has said that corpses of persons, who die of Coronavirus in the country can’t be claimed by their families for burial. According to Mohammed, such bodies would be contagious and therefore must be handled by ministry of health officials. Speaking in Abuja on Friday, the minister said, “Coronavirus is very dangerous and contagious; there is no medicine for it yet and it is not just capable of killing, overwhelming healthcare system, it will destroy the economy. “In some countries, they are putting dead bodies in big refrigerators because the morgues have filled up. “Nigerians should not forget that these are not the type of corpses that can be claimed for burial because it must be handled by the ministry of health.” Nigeria so far has 190 confirmed cases of Coronavirus with two recorded deaths.
