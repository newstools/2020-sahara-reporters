 Following growing concerns over the health implications of the 5G network, the Nigerian Government said it has not issued any licence for the deployment of the network in the country. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim, disclosed this in statement on Saturday in Abuja. He said that a three-month study trial on the network commenced on November 25, 2019 in order to review and study the health and security implications of deploying 5G in the country. The minister added that the trial process had been concluded and the study and reporting process is currently ongoing. He assured that government would always take the welfare, health and security of the public into account while considering the deployment of any technology. The statement reads, “The attention of my office has been drawn to the public concern about the health implications of the deployment of Fifth Generation Mobile Networks in Nigeria. “Based on available records at my office and the earlier report received from the regulator, I would like to clarify as follows. "The National Frequency Management Council of which I am the Chairman, has not deliberated on or released any bulk frequency spectrum for the deployment of 5G. "No license has been issued for the deployment of 5G in the country. “A three-month study trial commenced on November 25, 2019 in order to critically review and study the health and security implications of deploying 5G in Nigeria.
