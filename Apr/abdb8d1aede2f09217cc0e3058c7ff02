2 Days Ago Sources revealed to SaharaReporters that the governor suspended Danga to allow for an accelerated investigation into the case. Njemanze, who spoke with our correspondent, said the Kogi Government needed to do more to win the trust of the people by sacking Danga. She said, “There is absolutely no evidence of any suspension from the governor. “We demand evidence of the suspension. “It is important because the abuser has access to state resources through his office and has been using them to ensure the victim is discouraged from seeking justice.” The National Human Rights Commission has already waded into the case, assuring members of the public that it will follow up the case to the end. Executive Secretary, Tony Ojukwu, stated that no individual no matter how highly placed would be allowed to get away with impunity.
