  Who brought us here? In this broom republic! With their brooms Unemployment swept in This uncensored broom Sickness swept in Core hardship swept in Corruption this, corruption that, We are lost in dismay Transmission, transmission, oh confusion The Pharaohs of this generation.  Who brought us here? In this chicken republic Where we were, no longer where we are Diversified distraction and classified extortion ...and the priest lost his words. We tried finding our way back to where we were Alas! Firemen blocking our way In this technological era, Dubai's tall tower, China's moon car, The USA and Russians alike, And the broom republic Oh what a shame!  In this broom republic, The broomic stand of this broom saddens us The broomees see nothing wrong about this We are advancing? Nah, dehydrated! The dehydration of this nation needs a legislation, Who will pass the bill? We are lost and confused! Politiks of "touch not his anointed", And the disastrous prophet Godfathers and their rascality,  Area boys and their stupidity Break this jinx oh compatriots. Foreigners are scared Looting and re-looting in a nation, The gods are saddened This broom of peaceful disaster.  Who brought us here? Ghana must go, Ghana must go And this rejection brought greatness to that city Ah! This next level we desire,  ...but not from this callous broom Sick broom of uncircumcised division Hate speech, hate speech The body bag Mafian walks free And the innocent is apprehended Hunger strike and ASUU strike  The god of thunder must strike Our politicians have conspired against us Who shall deliver us from their wrath? A dropout I am cos of this broom Off my coast, they swept my education.  Oxford and Cambridge inhabits their wards Yet I was made a drop out? My life, I cannot surrender For this useless broom is become a disaster.
