  Bandits in Zamfara have killed two health workers supervising a polio vaccination round in the state, according to a report by PUNCH. The attack is said to have happened in Makosa Village, a precinct of Zurmi Local Government Area. An eye witness said the bandits stormed the village at noon and went straight to the primary health care centre, where the vaccination was going on. “They asked everyone to submit their belongings but the health workers, Lawali Suleiman and Liyu Mohammed, were shot for failing to comply. “After robbing the people of their belongings, the bandits also carted away their animals,” the source said. The police spokesperson in Zamfara confirmed the killing saying, “Those who launched the attack are part of the recalcitrant bandits who stormed the village with the intention of committing robbery. “The information we received was that the two health workers lost their lives because they didn’t surrender their handsets to the hoodlums who in turn became angry and killed them.”
