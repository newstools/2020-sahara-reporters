Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, has ordered all political appointees in his administration to submit their academic qualifications and curriculum vitae. The announcement contained in a circular with reference number SSG/ADM. 22/251 and signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Tokunbo Talabi, follows a SaharaReporters story revealing a move by disgraced university don, Sidi Osho's desperate move to doctor her records in order to be appointed commissioner in the state. Osho was sacked by the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, over alleged misconduct. The statement reads in part, “Kindly note that all political appointees are required to submit copies of their academic qualifications along with an updated copy of their curriculum vitae. “These documents should be collated and submitted to the office of the Secretary to the State Government.” The governing council of Olabisi Onabanjo University on Tuesday unanimously dismissed Osho’s appeal to convert her dismissal from the university to retirement or withdrawal from service.
