  Iran has shot a number of missiles into the United States military base in Iraq, according to the AFP. At least Iran fired 12 missiles into the base as revenge for America's killing of a top Iranian general. The Pentagon said it was still “working on initial battle damage assessments” after “Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against US military and coalition forces in Iraq”. “It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting US military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil,” the Pentagon said. There were no immediate reports on casualties but the Pentagon said it had been ready, after days of steadily mounting tension and exchanges of threats of war. “These bases have been on high alert due to indications that the Iranian regime planned to attack our forces and interests in the region,” a spokesman said. Iranian state television reported an attack on one base housing US personnel, saying it was in response to Friday’s killing in a US drone strike of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, one of the most important figures in the country’s government. Also killed was a top Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was with Soleimani just outside Baghdad international airport when the US drone struck. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards announced that the Ain al-Assad base was hit with dozens of missiles, warning that a US counter-attack would be met with an even “more crushing response.” In Washington, US President, Donald Trump, was “monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team,” according to the White House.
