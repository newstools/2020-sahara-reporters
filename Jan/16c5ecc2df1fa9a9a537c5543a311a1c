The House of Representatives in the United States of America has submitted two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate. The Democrat-led congress are accusing the president of abusing power and obstructing justice by trying to co-opt the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zilensky, to investigate Hunter Biden – son of Trump’s potential rival in this year’s elections, Joe Biden. “This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate,” Senate leader, Mich McConnell said. The upper chamber, which is dominated by Republicans, will today read out the charges against Trump on the floor. The chief justice of the country, John Roberts, will be sworn in afterward. He will proceed to swear members of the Senate, who will serve as jury. The House of Representatives are expected to send in members as well, they will act as prosecutors and will have the task of convincing an already biased jury that Trump should be convicted. “So sad, so tragic for our country, that the actions taken by the president to undermine our national security, to violate his oath of office and to jeopardise the security of our elections, has taken us to this place,” speaker of the lower chamber, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said on Wednesday. “This president will be held accountable,” she said, adding: “No one is above the law.”
