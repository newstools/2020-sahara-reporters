 A civil servant with the Nigerian Communications Commission, Abdul Hassan, has been arraigned in court for impersonating the Nigeriaâ€™s Senate President, Ahmed Lawal. Hassan was arraigned alongside one Bashiru now at large before a magistrate court in Abuja. Police prosecutor, Peter Ejike, told the court that the complainants, Chijioke Onuoha and Samson Menyaga, reported the matter at the Gwarinpa Police Station on January 13. Ejike alleged that on October 10, 2019, the defendant and his accomplice, Mr Bashiru, claimed to be aides of Lawal. He alleged that the two men collected N500,000 with a promise to get the complainants contracts from the National Assembly. The defendants however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The police said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 79,322, and 132 of the Penal Code. Magistrate Sharon Tanko in her ruling, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Tanko adjourned the case until March 10 for hearing.
