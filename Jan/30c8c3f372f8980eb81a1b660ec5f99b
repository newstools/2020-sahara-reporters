He said, “The justices of the Supreme Court brought shame to themselves; they brought shame to the judiciary in Nigeria and they brought shame to the people of Nigeria. Wherever they are now, they are ashamed of themselves. “But, we’re giving them the opportunity by this rally to clean themselves. They have to go back and reverse themselves. “They have to bring back justice to the people of Imo State who actually voted for Emeka Ihedioha during the 2019 election.”
