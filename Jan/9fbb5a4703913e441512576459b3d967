Scores of Gokada and Max bike riders on Friday stormed the Lagos State House of Assembly to protest the recent restrictions placed on bikes and tricycles in the city. Lamenting that the ban will only worsen the rate of joblessness in the state and take away their means of livelihood, the riders submitted a petition and pleaded with the state lawmakers to come to their aid. Responding to the plea of the motorcycle riders, Bisi Yusuf, a member of the house representing Alimosho Constituency, who spoke on behalf of the speaker, urged the demonstrators to obey the law pending when the legislature will look into their petition.
