 The Nigerian Navy has arrested three sea robbers suspected to have links with the pirates that killed four naval ratings in Ondo State. The suspects including Odun Ogunse, Adeojo Sunday and Edema ThankGod were arrested during the week by the team of naval officers in Igbokoda area of the state. Their arrest comes barely a day after the navy declared 33 sea pirates wanted for the abduction of three foreign sailors (two Russians and one Indian) in the Niger Delta. Recall the tragic incident that occurred penultimate weekend when some navy personnel were killed in a gunfight at Gagira, a suburb in the Awoye coastal community in Ilaje Local Government Area of the state. Commanding Officer, Forward Operating Base in Igbokoda, Commodore Danjuma Ndanusa, disclosed the arrest of the suspects to SaharaReporters in a chat on Friday. Ndanusa said the suspects were arrested in the creeks of the Niger Delta after extensive intelligence and surveillance. He identified the earlier arrest of another suspect Bamitale Iwatan, who is wanted for the kidnap of three foreign nationals. According to him, Iwatan alongside his gang members also stole a cache of ammunition belonging to the naval ratings during the rescue mission. Ndanusa added that the wanted criminal was an ex-militant who claimed to have repented during the amnesty programme of government but still engaged in criminal activities. He said, “We have issued out the names of those we arrested and handed them over to the Department of State Services for further investigation. “We are still looking for about 33 other suspects who have been perpetrating all sorts of crimes in the creeks across the region.”
