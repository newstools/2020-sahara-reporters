Nigeria's oldest World War veteran, Pa Adama Aduku, died at the age 101. His demise was announced by the Nigerian Army on Wednesday in a post on Twitter. In 2019, Aduku, from Kogi State, was honoured by the army authorities at a ceremony attended by Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo. He was in the Nigerian contingent that fought the British colonial army in Burma and Egypt during the Second World War. “This gallant soldier could not make it into 2020. We lost him yesterday (Tuesday). Rest in peace, great uncle,” the relation, Nats Odaudu, wrote.
