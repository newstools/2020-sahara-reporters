"When we called them, they said they are coming but they didn't come. "We just learnt that they stopped somewhere. When they (military) learnt that they (Fulani) burnt houses and killed people, they started coming to intervene but it was too late. 


SaharaReporters Media "We saw their faces, they were Fulani herdsmen and they all wore black. "There was no disagreement, they wrote on our walls that they were going to drive us away from the land because they said the land belonged to them. "During the attack, they were shouting 'Plateau belongs to us!', 'Bokkos belongs to us!'. "They want our land and are killing us to take it because the government is silent."
