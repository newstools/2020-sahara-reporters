The leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party on Friday in Abuja stormed the embassies of the United States and United Kingdom respectively to protest the Supreme Court judgment, which aw to the removal of Emeka Ihedioha as governor of Imo State. The team led by the National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, alongside members of the National Working Committee. Among the protesters are former Senate President, Adolphus Wabara, former Imo State governor, Achike Udenwa, and Senator Eyinnaya Abaribe among others. The protesters are asking the international community to prevail on the Supreme Court to reverse the judgment. Secondus asked the US and UK to prevail on the Nigerian Government to obey rule of law and not to truncate the nation's democracy. The party also said that it was in support of calls by Abaribe and other Nigerians for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari over the rising spate of insecurity. Secondus said, “On behalf of the PDP and the masses, we call on the international community to come to the assistance of our dear country. “The content of our letter is for international community to advise our government to obey the rule of law particularly as it relates to National Assembly and judiciary.” Secondus noted that President Buhari was overwhelmed with the security challenges in the country. The apex court had on January 14, 2020 declared Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress as the duly elected governor of the state, thereby bringing Ihedioha’s reign to an abrupt end.
