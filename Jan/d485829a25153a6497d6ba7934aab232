Hannatu Musawa As we enter the start of this brand new decade, I will outline my thoughts in this rhyming cascade. **************************************** For a start, there is chaos and confusion is displayed. The world is divided; People seem to be afraid. **************************************** From the start, 2019 came like a Nuclear Raid, With strain as Europe watched its unity fade. **************************************** In America insubordination was so clearly laid, As the President continued to give his office a downgrade. **************************************** In the World of entertainment, the fans felt betrayed, At the ending of Game of Thrones with Jon Snow’s blade. **************************************** But those who watched Marvel enjoyed the Crusade. The ending of The Avengers was brilliantly made. **************************************** In the Giant of Africa, the election heavily weighed, On the minds of Nigerians who diligently prayed. **************************************** Men, women traipsed out and at the polling booth stayed. One person, one vote in hopes the result would be swayed. **************************************** For APC, PDP and others, the tension was strained. The former was the victor but the vanquished complained. **************************************** I’ve been to many a court. The election will be maintained! Now PDP will feel how in the past, other parties were pained. -------------------------------------------------------- As we enter the decade of 2020 Vision, Let us make the decision of coalition our mission. As a race, put the condition of opposition in omission. And let go of derision, collision and division. At the volition of your intuition, use your resolution, To better your Self-Edition for your 2020 Vision. ------------------------------------------------------- With his mandate at hand, the President pressed, For a Next Level Agenda as his primary quest. **************************************** Determined not to let his legacy be messed, General gave a Ministerial List that nobody guessed. **************************************** Ignoring intrigue, lobby and desperation expressed, By those who thought that they had him possessed. **************************************** In the last administration, we were unimpressed, With those in the government that were devil infest. **************************************** For four years they continued to leave people oppressed. They bastardized the movement Buhari’s followers blessed. **************************************** It was hard to watch the destruction. We were depressed, With all those outsiders who weren’t part of the crest. **************************************** To understand, one must go back before the 2015 bequest, When the true followers sacrificed in the mightiest test. **************************************** For over a decade, they followed while they were oppressed. They shared the same values and their love their professed. **************************************** Very few got appointment in the past four-year digest. It may explain why appointees still have not progressed. **************************************** General, with hand on my chest, I make a solemn request; “Choose the best Nigerians from North, East, South and West!” -------------------------------------------------------- As we enter the decade of 2020 Vision, Let us make the decision of coalition our mission. As a race, put the condition of opposition in omission. And let go of derision, collision and division. At the volition of your intuition, use your resolution, To better your Self-Edition for your 2020 Vision. -------------------------------------------------------- Now internationally, there has been a global blight. The orange Oompaloompa in the States is given a fright. *************************************** To have an Internet troll as President is an offensive slight. His Twitter-fingers always searching for someone to fight. **************************************** But he met Armageddon while using his might, By trying to immorally force Ukraine to write. **************************************** Trump is the third President to be impeached outright. It will go down in US history. His Ego will bite! **************************************** Back in the Kingdom, Brexit continues its plight. It’s UK’s hugest mistake with benefit of hindsight. **************************************** Although Boris is eccentric, he is sure not contrite. He gained a huge victory due to his foresight. **************************************** Now Europe is in tatters. This just can’t be right. It’s the start of the end for a Union once bright. **************************************** Another huge scandal was Epstein’s sick plight, Of trafficking girls and keeping them in his sight. **************************************** But he chose suicide in a jail cell at midnight. Prince Andrew and others may fall for the same appetite. **************************************** Since the global narrative is the immigrant’s-despise. Let us each please fix our countries. I’m being quite trite. -------------------------------------------------------- As we enter the decade of 2020 Vision, Let us make the decision of coalition our mission. As a race, put the condition of opposition in omission. And let go of derision, collision and division. At the volition of your intuition, use your resolution, To better your Self-Edition for your 2020 Vision. -------------------------------------------------------- Coming back to Nigeria, where we are still in a knot, The Rule of Law was tested and it amounted to naught! **************************************** I honestly say this because in Law School I was taught, The State must obey court orders without an afterthought. **************************************** One case that is in point is when Sowore was caught, While calling for a protest using ‘Revolution’ as a mascot. **************************************** He was kept till the West demanded for him to be brought. By the time he was eventually released, the system was fraught. **************************************** Another conundrum was on Dasuki’s apparent onslaught. For years nobody saw him and thus thickens the plot. **************************************** Was he kept like in the Holocaust or kept in a nice spot? Now that he has been released, the story will be sought. **************************************** Then there is Zakzaky who we thought was left to rot. But we learnt from his mouth he is in a great place to squat. **************************************** In other news up in Kano, Ganduje continues to take a shot, At Sanusi, the Emir in a bid to remove him from his slot. **************************************** Even for a Layman, we know that Excellency you cannot, Continue demystifying a sacred Emirate as if it were a bottom pot. **************************************** 2023 Politics has started and if you read the subliminal report, Is the North trying to be shifty by playing a game of Argonaut. **************************************** Look, even if Arewa has the numbers, APC should not boycott, The Gentlemen agreement made or APC will be distraught. -------------------------------------------------------- As we enter the decade of 2020 Vision, Let us make the decision of coalition our mission. As a race, put the condition of opposition in omission. And let go of derision, collision and division. At the volition of your intuition, use your resolution, To better your Self-Edition for your 2020 Vision. -------------------------------------------------------- Now it is no big secret that we have so much on our tray. Starting with the lack of security Nigerians face everyday. *************************************** No longer do robbers just operate on the highway. These days, kidnappers come into homes to take us away. **************************************** We are just sitting ducks, we are the target, we are prey. That is why between Abuja and Kaduna, most take the railway. **************************************** One cannot leave out the Politics our leaders portray, Where the individual interest seems to often outweigh. **************************************** We really cannot make headway if all that is on display, Is politics where “Me, Myself and I” becomes our mainstay. **************************************** To be honest, it is not everyone that is part of the decay. It is just that those with honor are countable in this soiree. **************************************** As we approach the next election, there is so much at play. People are positioning to take over according to hearsay. *************************************** APC had a Gentleman Agreement, which they should not betray. Power must be allocated to the South or it will be foul play. -------------------------------------------------------- As we enter the decade of 2020 Vision, Let us make the decision of coalition our mission. As a race, put the condition of opposition in omission. And let go of derision, collision and division. At the volition of your intuition, use your resolution, To better your Self-Edition for your 2020 Vision. -------------------------------------------------------- As we face a new frontier in this baby New Year, I urge all Nigerians to adhere to volunteer. To steer and be near what is good and sincere. To cheer for our nation, so it can persevere. **************************************** The smear of Nigeria has been quite severe. We are known as the scamming and 419 pioneer. **************************************** To add insult to injury, it does thus appear, Our nation has been added to the terrorism sphere. **************************************** Our forefathers fought to clear our atmosphere, From the disunity, destruction we see in our veneer. **************************************** A Zik, Sardauna, they were the pioneer, Of this beautiful land; our greatest souvenir. **************************************** Balewa and Macaulay did diligently commandeer, In nurturing this nation so that each of us can cheer. **************************************** Eyo Ita and Ikoku stood up to shape the sphere, Of the evolution of this country so we could profiteer. **************************************** Enahoro and Sir Udoma continued to, thus, appear, Whenever we were taking the wrong and backward gear. **************************************** Osadebay and Joseph Tarka were always quite severe, In protecting Nigeria from any negative interfere. **************************************** Chief Ajayi and Awoniyi were the opposite of insincere. They were each what you would call progressive engineer. **************************************** When I think of Aminu Kano, for me, it brings a tear. He wanted poor Nigerians to smile from ear to ear. **************************************** For our forefathers let us make sure we strongly reappear. Let us be the greatest nation in the Northern Hemisphere. **************************************** D fellows, dear comrades, Nigerians far and near, Don’t tear up, let’s gear up, let’s be austere, and let’s cheer. *************************************** Let’s fight for our nation, without favor, without fear. Let’s clear misconceptions and make them disappear. **************************************** From the North to the South and the middle; front and rear, Nigerian’s are one, we are peer, and none should domineer. **************************************** As we usher in the decade of 2020 perfect Vision here, Let us leave bad energy and chakra to go with yesteryear. **************************************** Our Motherland is warn, we must conform Nigerian’s dear.
