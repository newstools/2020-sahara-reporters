New governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, has described the ruling of the Supreme Court as what was expected. Uzodinma, who was declared winner of the March 2019 Imo State governorship election by the Supreme Court on Tuesday, said the tribunal and the Appeal Court acted wrongly by not ruling in his favour. Speaking to journalists after receiving his Certificate of Return from the Independent National Electoral Commission, Uzodinma said the people of Imo were denied their choice of leadership with Emeka Ihedioha announced as winner after the election. He added that his victory at the apex court showed the judiciary was functioning. He said, “That is what we did and the first court did not do what we wanted. The second court followed through, but the Supreme Court used its eagle eye and gave us victory. “We thank God that at the end of the day the wishes and mandate of Imo people have been recognised. “We owe this victory to God Almighty. We owe it to the functional judiciary. That our judiciary is working and the Supreme Court worked to expectation.” Uzodinma had in his first move after being declared winner by the court written to all financial institutions to freeze the government's account until further notice.
