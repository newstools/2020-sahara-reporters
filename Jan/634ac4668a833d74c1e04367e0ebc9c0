 Ex-serviceman, Daniel Ganga, has criticised the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari over the unending campaign against Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East of Nigeria. Ganga spoke at the Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebration in Yola, Adamawa State, on Wednesday, noting that Nigeria was more divided today than at any previous time in history. He said, “The present regime has jeopardised efforts why we fought the Civil War. “That's why you can see the way that they are going about the war against Boko Haram. Our children are dying anyhow. “For me, nothing can be done to rescue anything because all service chiefs are misleading the president.” Speaking at the event, the Brigade Commander of 23 Brigade Yola, Brigadier General Sani Mohammed assured that there was an end in sight of Boko Haram insurgency. He said, “Certainly there is an end in sight of Boko Haram insurgency because a lot of progress has been achieved. “A lot of development in terms of pushing the operations forward has been made in bringing the fight to an end.”
