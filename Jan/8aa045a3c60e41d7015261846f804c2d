Three former executive members of the Ondo State Ministry of Culture and Tourism Cooperative, Thrift and Credit Society have been docked at the stateâ€™s High Court for allegedly committing fraud. The trio of Ehinola Mojisola, Olubo Mercy Kehinde and Alade Femi Augustina were dragged before Justice Samuel Bola of the High Court sitting in Akure. The three defendants were arraigned by police on a nine-count charge bordering on conspiracy to commit felony, forging of documents and stealing. John Dada Joshua, prosecutor in case, told the court that the three suspects fraudulent tendered false statements of account of the ministry's cooperative society while serving as executive members between 2014 and 2019. Joshua disclosed that the trio also forged the receipt of the Ondo State Civil Service Employee No (cs no.) and fraudulently converted to their own personal purse the sum of N11, 311, 605, 02 belonging to the members of the cooperative society. According to the prosecutor, the defendants allegedly stole another sum of N3, 611, 144, 34 with additional N3, 896, 095, 34. He revealed that the total money allegedly stolen by the three defendants from the cooperative society account totalled N22.6m. But the defence counsel, Charles Titiloye, objected some of the allegations and noted that there were some grey areas that should have been amended in the case. In his ruling, Justice Bola adjourned the case until February 6, 2020 for the amendment of processes and proper hearing.
