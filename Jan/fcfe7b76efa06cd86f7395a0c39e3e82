  Barely one week after gunmen suspected to be assassins killed the Olomu Ward 1 Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Paul Onomuakporkpo, in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State, another member of the party in the Ethiope East Local Government Area of the state has been killed by suspected assassins. SaharaReportersÂ gathered that the victim whose name was given as Wisdom Ovie, was murdered at his residence in Abraka community on Wednesday at about 10:26pm while taking his bath. It was however, alleged in some quarters that the deceased, who was a member of the social media team of the PDP in Ethiope East council, may have been murdered over some kind of disagreement with persons believed to be Internet fraudsters. Meanwhile members of civil society organisations in the state as well as politicians in the area including the local government council chairperson, Faith Majemite, have condemned the gruesome murder of Wisdom. According to the council chairperson, they were already working in synergy with the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the area to arrest those behind the heinous crime. Calls put across to the Delta State Commissioner of Police, Hafiz Inuwa, over the matter were not responded to as at the time of filing in this story. Wisdom, who is said to be in his early 30s, was married with two children.
