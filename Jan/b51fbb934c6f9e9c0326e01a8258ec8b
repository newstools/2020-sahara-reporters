 The Oyo State Command of the Nigeria Police Force has denied shooting any civilian following the inferno that razed Akesan Market in Oyo town. Spokesperson for the command, Olugbenga Fadeyi, claimed the shooting was carried out by a sister organisation and that one one person was killed contrary to news reports. He said besides the death of one person, three others sustained bullet wounds, adding that the injured were recuperating in a medical facility at Oyo. He said, “The attention of the Commissioner of Police, Oyo State, Shina Olukolu, has been drawn to the purported story being reported by some media houses and online publications that police personnel in Oyo town, consequent upon the violent reactions by the citizens upon the inability of the Fire Service to deal with the fire incident that occurred at Akesan Market in Oyo town, allegedly shot dead three persons. The fire was allegedly allowed to fester, which led to a substantial part of the market being burnt. “The Commissioner of Police wishes to state categorically that contrary to the widely spread rumour of police killings that there was no single shot fired by the police personnel deployed to provide security on the scene of the fire incident. “A report was received at the Durbar Police Station by the DPO that a sister security agency had arrived on the scene to assist in the provision of security. “Unfortunately, gunshots rang out from their direction skywards and one Aderoju Akano, male, aged 14, was allegedly hit and he died, while three others, namely Jimoh Idris, male, aged 14, Sulu Qudinai, male, aged 20 and Wasiu Taiwo, male, aged 21 sustained gunshot injuries and are recuperating in a hospital in Oyo town."
