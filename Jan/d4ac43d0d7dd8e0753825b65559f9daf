She said, “The government of Akeredolu is working assiduously to make sure that teachers are recruited into public schools. "The last time recruitment was done was during the tenure of late Olusegun Agagu. At the moment, we have a deficit of 8000 teachers in our schools. "In order to salvage the situation before embarking on massive recruitment, we are presently drawing officers who have education background in the civil service and local government service to the primary schools.”
