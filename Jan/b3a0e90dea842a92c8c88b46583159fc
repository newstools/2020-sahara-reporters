 Sacked governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, has said that he does not agree with the judgment of the Supreme Court that ordered his removal from office but had no option but to obey the ruling. Ihedioha however, said that the court did not consider the fact and legal precedence while delivering the ruling. He said, “No doubt, the Supreme Court’s verdict came to us as a rude shock and surprise considering the facts on ground, legal precedence and clear verdict of Imo people on March 9, 2019, that returned me as governor with the highest valid votes of 273,404. “I do not agree with the judgment of the Supreme Court. I think it is unfair, unjust and does not reflect the voting that took place during the elections. “It also didn’t take care of the sensibilities of the people of Imo State. But as true democrats, Engr Gerald Irona and I have no option but to respect the outcome of that judgment.” He announced that he had put machinery in place to begin the handing over process as he directed all political appointees to send in their resignation letter and also return all state properties in their possession.
