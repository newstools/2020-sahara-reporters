Shehu Sani with Alhaji Sani Dauda, ownner of ASD Motors The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission might be bringing Sani Dauda, a businessman, who accused former senator, Shehu Sani, of extortion to restate his allegation in the presence of the ex-lawmaker. Sani was arrested by the commission following a petition by Dauda, accusing him of extorting $20,000 from him. He alleged the former senator had claimed to have a good relationship with the Acting Chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, and would intervene on his behalf regarding an issue he has with the anti-graft agency. Sani has denied extorting Dauda, owner of ASD Motors, and has agreed to a physical interaction with the businessman, according to a report by The Nation. Quoting a source, the newspaper said the commission has mandated Dauda to bring in relevant documents to prove his allegations. “The EFCC acted on a petition from the car dealer. We did not create the document. “Detectives will engage Dauda on Thursday (today) and the senator. We have asked him to bring all relevant documents on the transactions between the two parties. “We are also screening the contents of telephone messages between the senator and Dauda. “We have two parallel claims. It is our job as investigators to sieve the information at our disposal,” the source said.
