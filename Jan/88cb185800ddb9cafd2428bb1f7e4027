 Jihadists from Somalia’s Al-Shabaab group on Sunday attacked a military base used by United States and Kenyan forces in Kenya’s coastal Lamu region, a government official said. “There was an attack but they have been repulsed,” Lamu Commissioner, Irungu Macharia, told AFP. He said the attack took place before dawn at the base known as Camp Simba, and that “a security operation is ongoing”, without saying if there had been casualties. “We are not sure if there are still remnants within,” he said. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, saying they had “successfully stormed the heavily fortified military base and have now taken effective control of part of the base.” The group said there had been both Kenyan and American casualties, however this could not be immediately verified. Al-Shabaab said the attack was part of its “Al-Quds (Jerusalem) shall never be Judaised” campaign — a term it first used during an attack on the upscale Dusit hotel complex in Nairobi in January last year that left 21 people dead.
