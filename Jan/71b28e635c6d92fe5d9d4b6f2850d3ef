  Despite having all the prerequisites to become a superpower, Nigeria staggered from one crisis to another â€“ as a result of poor leadership, maladministration, ineptitude, recklessness, lawlessness, nepotism, clannishness, plundering of resources and squandering of riches. Nigeria being a one third of the population of Africa would have become Africa's first superpower and a stabilising democratic influence on the continent given the enormous amount of resources; minerals and human per capital including the most educated workforce in Africa. Nigeria is so ethnically, religiously and linguistically polarised to such an extent that.... Championed by vitriolic ethnic chauvinist, under succession of increasingly unpopular authoritarian regimes both civil and military, leading to mutual suspicious and hostility. By the examples of Nigeria, our beloved continent is still weighed down by trivia and mundane issues, instead of advancement of technology, research and development. Clearly, this is obviously a certified case of a failed state. Sanctity of the ballot box can no longer be assured, security of lives and properties nil, infrastructure zero, social security nope, harassment of journalist and opposition elements in the increase. Hunger and hopelessness, legislative arm completely non-existing, judiciary completely undermined, complete systemic failure. The foundation was laid by the inglorious past regimes particularly the Olusegun Obasanjo era.
