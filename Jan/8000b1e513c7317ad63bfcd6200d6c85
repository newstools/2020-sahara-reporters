The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has barred married people from participating in its ongoing recruitment process. In the recruitment notice of the agency, one of the criteria listed was that the applicant must be single. The decision has, however, been criticised by the Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association, an affiliate of the Nigeria Labour Congress. Director-General of NECA, Timothy Olawale, told PUNCH that the EFCC’s action was in contravention of International Labour Organisation’s conventions. Olawale said, “The issue of inclusion is one of the problems we have in this country. We always find a way to exclude people. One of the principles of fair recruitment is fairness. What the EFCC has done is in contravention of ILO conventions. “During recruitment, you don’t segregate any class. Even if you will apply some factors discretionally in the course of recruitment, you don’t make it public. What offence have married people committed?”
