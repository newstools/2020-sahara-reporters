 Policemen from Zone 2, Lagos, have arrested six persons alleged to have illegally demolished property worth N76m at a site located along Iju Road, Agege. The arrest was as a result of a petition by the management of Masters Reality International Ltd, owners of the damaged property. In the petition, the company's management complained to the police how the property was demolished and many of its equipment destroyed by men of Lagos State Task Force on Land Grabbing, who invaded the site on Saturday. On receiving the petition, police swiftly swung into action by moving to the site at Agege and arrested the six members of the task force team. The police also sent a letter of invitation to the Coordinator, Lagos State Task Force on Land Grabbing, Mr Owolabi Arole, who has allegedly claimed responsibility for the demolition of the property. Speaking on the matter, counsel to Masters Reality International Concept Ltd, Luqman Iman, stated that the demolition carried out by the task force team was illegal because such cannot be done without a valid court order. He added that there was no section in Lagos State statutory law that empowers Task Force on Land Grabbing to demolish a property. Iman said that only the Lagos State Building Control Agency can demolish property under the state law. It was gathered that Masters Reality International Concept management contacted LASBCA in the course of the demolition exercise and the agency vehemently denied authorising such. The company stated that despite the provocative action of the men of the task force, it would wait for police investigation before deciding on its next line of action.
