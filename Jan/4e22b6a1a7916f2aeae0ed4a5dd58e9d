Chido Nwangwu For how long/ Should I appease those/ All-knowing gods of mediocrity? For how long/ Should I be that/ Sacrificial, monthly burnt offering to their Peaceful gods of mayhem? For how long/ Should I be that/ Target of some reptilian, choking, bloody Dances of death, in my own village by these/ Gentle troops of lethal impunity? For how long/ Should I be that/ Brave one without means and things to Defend the herd of goat in the homestead/ Protect the frontline stock of The courageous, at home and elsewhere? Ahamefuna-Afamefuna-Ahamefule For how long/ Should I be that/ Overcomer who, continues to fall for the instigation to cast all My survivalists’ discretion to their whirlwind, Toxtrotting, into their deathly reptilian dances? For how long/ Should I forget/ For their fear of Biafra, Targeted persons, we’ve become; all Offsprings of Odumegwu, the Lion of Biafra! We’ve become; all Witness bearers and truth-tellers/ In unapologetic agreement with ‘Ugonabo’ Chinua Achebe who wrote: There was a country! I say, it was not Wakanda; it was Biafra!
