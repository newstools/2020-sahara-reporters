Head of Unit, Hydrology and Climate (Water Resources) at the National Centre for Remote Sensing, Onoja Desmond, explained this during an interview with Daily Trust newspaper. He added that the jet streams and harmattan wind are other contributing factors. Desmond said temperatures would likely drop further in the coming years, exposing residents to colder weather conditions unless the issues of climate change are checked globally. He explained that jet streams, which are rapidly moving air at the upper level of the atmosphere as well as the North-East trade wind, otherwise referred to as harmattan with the altitude of Jos, the Plateau State capital has made the city the coldest in the country.
