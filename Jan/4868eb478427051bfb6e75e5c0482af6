  The United Nations Resident Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, has said that a total of 12 humanitarian workers lost their lives in 2019. He called on abductors of the two aids workers still held to release them immediately. In a statement by the UNOCHA Nigeria on Thursday, he said, “A total of 12 aid workers lost their lives in 2019. “This is twice more than in 2018, which we thought was amongst the most dangerous years for humanitarian actors in Nigeria. “Aid workers and the assistance they provide to the most vulnerable populations make the difference between life and death for entire communities in crisis-affected Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states. Their security is paramount and I call on all parties to assure the safety of aid workers and the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid. “Despite this encouraging news, I am concerned about the fate of the other civilians abducted in this incident. “I also remain gravely concerned for the lives of our ACF colleague Grace Taku, abducted near Damasak in July 2019, and Alice Loksha, a nurse and a mother, abducted during an attack in Rann in March 2018. “Both are still held captive by non-state armed groups. The United Nations and its humanitarian partners call for their immediate and safe release. “I am deeply relieved that some civilians, including three aid workers, who were abducted by non-state armed groups along the Monguno-Maiduguri Road on December 22, 2019 have been released yesterday and are now safe. “The whole humanitarian community in Nigeria shares the joy of the families, friends and colleagues of these aid workers, who can now put to rest the unimaginable anxiety of missing their loved ones.”
